chapter 1


is truth universallycknowledged, that single man possession
good fortune, must be want wife.

however little known feelings views such man may be on his
first entering neighbourhood, truth is so well fixed minds
surrounding families, that he is considered rightful property
some one otherir daughters.

“my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady him one day, “have you heard that
netherfield park is lett last?”

mr. bennet replied that he had not.

“but is,” returned she; “fmrs. long has just been here,nd she
told mellbout.”

mr. bennet made nonswer.

“do you not want know who has taken?” cried his wife impatiently.

“_you_ want tell me,nd i have no objection hearing.”

wasvitation enough.

“why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
by young man large fortune from north england; that he came
down on monday chaisend four see place,nd was so much
delighted, that hegreed mr. morris immediately; that he
is take possession before michaelmas,nd some his servantsre
be house by end next week.”

“what is his name?”

“bingley.”

“is he married single?”

“oh! single, my dear, be sure! single man large fortune; four
five thousyear. what fine thing four girls!”

“how so? how canffectm?”

“my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! you
must know that im thinking his marrying onem.”

“is that his design settling here?”

“design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but is very likely that he
_may_ fall love onem,ndrefore you must vishims
soons he comes.”

“i see no occasion fthat. yound girls may go, you may send
them bymselves, which perhaps will be still better, fors youre
as handsomesnym, mr. bingley may like you best
party.”

“my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share beauty, but
i do not pretend benything extraordinary now. when woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought give over thinking her own beauty.”

“such cases, woman has notten much beauty think.”

“but, my dear, you mustdeed gond see mr. bingley when he comesto
neighbourhood.”

“is more than i engage for, issure you.”

“but consider your daughters. only think whatn establishment would
be fonem. sir williamnd lady lucasre determined
go, merely on thatccount, fgeneral, you know,y visno
newcomers.deed you must go, fwill be impossible f_us_
vishim if you do not.”

“youre over-scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very
glad see you;nd i will send few lines by youssure him my
hearty consent his marrying whichever he chooses girls; though
i must throw good word fmy little lizzy.”

“i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not bbetter than
others;nd im sure she is not half so handsomes jane, nhalf so
good-humoureds lydia. but yourelways giving _her_ preference.”

“they have nonem much recommendm,” replied he; “theyre
all sillynd ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more
quickness than her sisters.”

“mr. bennet, how _can_ youbuse your own children such way? you
take delight vexing me. you have no compassion fmy ponerves.”

“you mistake me, my dear. i have high respect fyour nerves.y
are my old friends. i have heard you mentionm consideration
these last twenty yearst least.”

“ah, you do not know what i suffer.”

“but i hope you will get over,nd live see many young men four
thousyear comeneighbourhood.”

“will be no use us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visthem.”

“depend upon, my dear, that whenrere twenty, i will visthem
all.”

mr. bennet was so odd mixture quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve,nd caprice, that experience three-and-twenty years had
beensufficient make his wife understhis character. _her_ mind
was less difficult develop. she was woman mean understanding,
littleformation,nd uncertatemper. when she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. business her life was get her
daughters married;s solace was visitingnd news.



chapter 2


mr. bennet wasmong earliest those who waited on mr. bingley. he
hadlwaystended vishim, though lastlwaysssuring
his wife that he should not go;nd till eveningfter viswas
paid she had no knowledge. wasn disclosed following
manner. observing his second daughter employed trimming hat, he
suddenlyddressed her:

“i hope mr. bingley will like, lizzy.”

“were not way know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said her mother
resentfully, “since were not visit.”

“but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet himt
assemblies,nd that mrs. long promisedtroduce him.”

“i do not believe mrs. long will dony such thing. she has two nieces
her own. she is selfish, hypocritical woman,nd i have no opinion
her.”

“no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “im glad find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”

mrs. bennet deigned not makeny reply, but, unable contain
herself, began scolding one her daughters.

“don't keep coughing so, kitty, fheaven's sake! have little
compassion on my nerves. you tearm pieces.”

“kitty has no discretion her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”

“i do not cough fmy ownmusement,” replied kitty fretfully. “when is
your next ball be, lizzy?”

“to-morrow fortnight.”

“aye, so is,” cried her mother, “mrs. long does not come back
till day before; so will be impossible fhertroduce him,
fshe will not know him herself.”

“then, my dear, you may havedvantage your friend,ndtroduce
mr. bingley _her_.”

“impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when im notcquainted him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”

“i honour your circumspection. fortnight'scquaintance is certainly
very little. one cannot know what man really is by end
fortnight. but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will;ndfterll,
mrs. longnd her neices must sttheir chance;nd,refore,s
she will thinknct kindness, if you declinefice, i will
take on myself.”

girls staredtir father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense,
nonsense!”

“what can be meaning that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
you consider formstroduction,nd stress that is laid on
them,s nonsense? i cannot quitegree you _there_. what say you,
mary? fyoure young lady deep reflection, i know,nd read
great booksnd make extracts.”

mary wished say something sensible, but knew not how.

“while mary isdjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return mr.
bingley.”

“im sick mr. bingley,” cried his wife.

“im sorry hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? if
i had knowns much morning i certainly would not have called
on him. is very unlucky; buts i havectually paid visit, we
cannot escapecquaintance now.”

thestonishment ladies was just what he wished; that mrs.
bennet perhaps surpassing rest; though, when first tumult joy
was over, she began declare that was what she had expectedll
while.

“how good was you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should
persuade yout last. i was sure you loved your girlso well
neglect suchncquaintance. well, how pleased im!nd is such
good joke,o, that you should have gone morningnd never said
wordbout till now.”

“now, kitty, you may coughs muchs you choose,” said mr. bennet;nd,
as he spoke, he left room, fatigued raptures his wife.

“whatn excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when dowas
shut. “i do not know how you will ever make himmends fhis kindness;
me, either, fthat matter.t our time life is not so
pleasant, i can tell you, be making newcquaintances every day; but
fyour sakes, we would donything. lydia, my love, though you _are_
youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance yout next
ball.”

“oh!” said lydistoutly, “im notfraid; fthough i _am_
youngest, i'm tallest.”

rest evening was spent conjecturing how soon he would
return mr. bennet's visit,nd determining wheny shouldsk him
dinner.



chapter 3


notll that mrs. bennet, however,ssistance her five
daughters, couldsk on subject, was sufficient draw from her
husbandny satisfactory description mr. bingley.yttacked him
various ways--barefaced questions,genious suppositions,nd
distant surmises; but he eluded skillmll,ndy weret
last obligedccept second-hintelligenceir neighbour,
lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been
delighted him. he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable,nd, crown whole, he meant bet nextssembly
large party. nothing could be more delightful! be fond
dancing was certastepwards falling love;nd very lively
hopes mr. bingley's heart were entertained.

“if i can but see one my daughters happily settledt netherfield,”
 said mrs. bennet her husband, “andll others equally well
married, i shall have nothing wish for.”

few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet's visit,nd satbout
ten minutes him his library. he had entertained hopes being
admitted sight young ladies, whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only father. ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, fory haddvantagescertaining fromn upper
window that he wore blue coat,nd rode black horse.

anvitation dinner was soonfterwards dispatched;ndlready
had mrs. bennet planned courses that were do credher
housekeeping, whennnswerrrived which deferredll. mr. bingley
was obliged bewn following day,nd, consequently, unable
toccept honourirvitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite
disconcerted. she could not imagine what business he could havewn
so soonfter hisrrival hertfordshire;nd she began fear that
he might belways flyingbout from one placenother,nd never
settledt netherfields he ought be. lady lucas quieted her fears
little by starting idehis being gone london only get
large party fball;nd report soon followed that mr. bingley
was bring twelve ladiesnd seven gentlemen himssembly.
girls grieved over such number ladies, but were comforted
day before ball by hearing, thatstead twelve he brought only
six him from london--his five sistersnd cousin.nd when
party enteredssembly room consisted only five
altogether--mr. bingley, his two sisters, husbeldest,nd
another young man.

mr. bingley was good-lookingnd gentlemanlike; he had pleasant
countenance,nd easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women,
withnir decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
looked gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drewttention
room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien,nd
report which was general circulationfive minutes
after his entrance, his having ten thousyear. gentlemen
pronounced him be fine figure man, ladies declared he
was much handsomer than mr. bingley,nd he was lookedt great
admiration forbout half evening, till his manners gave disgust
which turned tide his popularity; fhe was discovered be
proud; bebove his company,ndbove being pleased;nd notll
his large estate derbyshire couldn save him from having most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance,nd being unworthy be compared
his friend.

mr. bingley had soon made himselfcquaintedll principal
people room; he was livelynd unreserved, danced every dance,
wasngry that ball closed so early,nd talked giving
one himselft netherfield. suchmiable qualities must speak for
themselves. what contrast between himnd his friend! mr. darcy danced
only once mrs. hurstnd once miss bingley, declined being
introducedny other lady,nd spent rest evening
walkingbout room, speaking occasionally one his own party.
his character was decided. he was proudest, most disagreeable man
world,nd everybody hoped that he would never comeregain.
amongst most violentgainst him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike
his general behaviour was sharpenedparticular resentment by his
having slighted one her daughters.

elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by scarcity gentlemen, sit
down ftwo dances;nd during part that time, mr. darcy had been
standing near enough fher hear conversation between himnd mr.
bingley, who came from dance ffew minutes, press his friend
join.

“come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate see you
standingbout by yourself stupid manner. you had much better
dance.”

“i certainly shall not. you know how i detest, unless im
particularlycquainted my partner.t suchnssemblys
would besupportable. your sistersre engaged,ndre is not
another woman room whom would not be punishment me
stup.”

“i would not be so fastidiouss youre,” cried mr. bingley, “for
kingdom! upon my honour, i never met so many pleasant girls
my lifes i have evening;ndrere severalm you see
uncommonly pretty.”

“_you_re dancing only handsome girl room,” said mr.
darcy, lookingt eldest miss bennet.

“oh! she is most beautiful creature i ever beheld! butre is one
her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty,nd i
dare say verygreeable. do let mesk my partnertroduce you.”

“which do you mean?”nd turning round he looked fmomentt
elizabeth, till catching her eye, hedrew his ownnd coldly said:
“she islerable, but not handsome enough tempt _me_; im no
humourt present give consequence young ladies whore slighted
by other men. you had better return your partnernd enjoy her
smiles, fyoure wasting your time me.”

mr. bingley followed hisdvice. mr. darcy walkedf;nd elizabeth
remained no very cordial feelingsward him. sheld story,
however, great spiritmong her friends; fshe had lively,
playful disposition, which delightednything ridiculous.

eveningltogether passedf pleasantly whole family. mrs.
bennet had seen her eldest daughter muchdmired by netherfield
party. mr. bingley had danced her twice,nd she had been
distinguished by his sisters. jane wass much gratified bys
her mother could be, though quieter way. elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned miss bingleys most
accomplished girl neighbourhood;nd catherinend lydihad been
fortunate enough never beout partners, which wasll thaty
had yet learnt care fort ball.y returned,refore, good
spirits longbourn, village wherey lived,nd whichy
were principalhabitants.y found mr. bennet still up.
book he was regardless time;nd on present occasion he had
good deal curiositys eventn evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that his wife's views on
stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had
different story hear.

“oh! my dear mr. bennet,”s she entered room, “we have had most
delightful evening, most excellent ball. i wish you had beenre.
jane was sodmired, nothing could be like. everybody said how well
she looked;nd mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful,nd danced
her twice! only think _that_, my dear; hectually danced her
twice!nd she was only creature room that hesked second
time. firstll, hesked miss lucas. i was so vexed see him stand
up her! but, however, he did notdmire hertll;deed, nobody
can, you know;nd he seemed quite struck janes she was going
down dance. so hequired who she was,nd gottroduced,nd
asked her ftwo next.n two third he danced miss king,
two fourth marilucas,nd two fifth janegain,
two sixth lizzy,nd _boulanger_--”

“if he had hadny compassion f_me_,” cried her husbimpatiently,
“he would not have danced half so much! fgod's sake, say no more
his partners. oh that he had sprained hisnkle first dance!”

“oh! my dear, im quite delighted him. he is so excessively
handsome!nd his sistersre charming women. i never my life saw
anything more elegant thanir dresses. i dare say lace upon mrs.
hurst's gown--”

here she wasterruptedgain. mr. bennet protestedgainstny
description finery. she wasrefore obliged seeknother branch
subject,nd related, much bitterness spiritnd some
exaggeration, shocking rudeness mr. darcy.

“but i canssure you,” shedded, “that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; fhe is most disagreeable, horrid man, nott
all worth pleasing. so highnd so conceited thatre was no enduring
him! he walked here,nd he walkedre, fancying himself so very
great! not handsome enough dance! i wish you had beenre, my
dear, have given him one your set-downs. i quite detest man.”



chapter 4


when janend elizabeth werelone, former, who had been cautious
her praise mr. bingley before, expressed her sister just how very
much shedmired him.

“he is just what young man ought be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively;nd i never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, such perfect good breeding!”

“he islso handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which young man ought
likewise be, if he possibly can. his character isreby complete.”

“i was very much flattered by hissking me dance second time. i
did not expect such compliment.”

“did not you? i did fyou. but that is one great difference between
us. complimentslways take _you_ by surprise,nd _me_ never. what
could be more natural than hissking yougain? he could not help
seeing that you werebout five timess prettys every other woman
room. no thanks his gallantry fthat. well, he certainly is
verygreeable,nd i give you leave like him. you have liked many
stupider person.”

“dear lizzy!”

“oh! youre great dealopt, you know, like people general.
you never see faultnybody.ll worldre goodndgreeable
your eyes. i never heard you speak ill human being your
life.”

“i would not wish be hasty censuringnyone; but ilways speak
what i think.”

“i know you do;nd is _that_ which makes wonder. _your_
good sense, be so honestly blind folliesnd nonsense
others!ffectation candour is common enough--one meets
everywhere. but be candidout ostentation design--take
good everybody's characternd make still better,nd say nothing
bad--belongs youlone.nd so you like man's sisters,
too, do you?ir mannersre not equal his.”

“certainly not--at first. butyre very pleasing women when you
conversem. miss bingley is live her brother,nd keep
his house;nd im much mistaken if we shall not find very charming
neighbour her.”

elizabeth listened silence, but was not convinced;ir behaviourt
thessembly had not been calculated please general;nd more
quickness observationnd less pliancy temper than her sister,
judgemenunassailed bynyttention herself, she
was very little disposedpprovem.y were fact very fine
ladies; not deficient good humour wheny were pleased, nin
power makingmselvesgreeable wheny chose, but proudnd
conceited.y were rather handsome, had been educated one
first private seminarieswn, had fortune twenty thousand
pounds, were habspending more thany ought,nd
associating people rank,nd wererefore every respect
entitled think wellmselves,nd meanly others.y were
respectable family north england; circumstance more deeply
impressed onir memories than thatir brother's fortunendir
own had beencquired by trade.

mr. bingleyherited propertymount nearly hundred
thouspounds from his father, who hadtended purchasen
estate, but did not live do. mr. bingleytended likewise,nd
sometimes made choice his county; buts he was now provided
good housend liberty manor, was doubtful many those
who best knew easiness his temper, whether he might not spend
remainder his dayst netherfield,nd leave next generation
purchase.

his sisters werenxious fhis havingn estate his own; but,
though he was now only establisheds tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling presidet his table--nwas mrs. hurst, who had
married man more fashion than fortune, less disposed consider
his houses her home when suited her. mr. bingley had not been
age two years, when he was tempted bynccidental recommendation
lookt netherfield house. he did lookt,ndfor
half-an-hour--was pleased situationnd principal
rooms, satisfied what owner saids praise,ndok
immediately.

between himnd darcyre was very steady friendship, spite
great opposition character. bingley was endeared darcy by
easiness, openness,nd ductility his temper, though no disposition
couldfer greater contrast his own,nd though his own he
neverppeared dissatisfied. on strength darcy's regard, bingley
had firmest reliance,nd his judgement highest opinion.
understanding, darcy was superior. bingley was by no means
deficient, but darcy was clever. he wast same time haughty,
reserved,nd fastidious,nd his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. that respect his friend had greatlydvantage. bingley
was sure being liked wherever heppeared, darcy was continually
givingfense.

manner whichy spoke merytonssembly was sufficiently
characteristic. bingley had never met more pleasant people
prettier girls his life; everybody had been most kindndttentive
him;re had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
acquaintedll room;nd,s miss bennet, he could not
conceivenngel more beautiful. darcy, on contrary, had seen
collection people whomre was little beautynd no fashion, for
none whom he had felt smallestterest,nd from none received
eitherttention pleasure. miss bennet hecknowledged be pretty,
but she smiledo much.

mrs. hurstnd her sisterllowed be so--but stillydmired
hernd liked her,nd pronounced her be sweet girl,nd one
whomy would not object know more. miss bennet wasrefore
establisheds sweet girl,ndir brother feltuthorized by such
commendation think hers he chose.



chapter 5


withshort walk longbourn lived family whom bennets
were particularlytimate. sir william lucas had been formerly trade
meryton, where he had madelerable fortune,nd risen
honour knighthood bynddress king during his mayoralty.
distinction had perhaps been felstrongly. had given him
disgust his business,nd his residence small marketwn;
and, quittingm both, he had removed his family house
about mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge,
where he could think pleasure his own importance,nd,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely being civilll
world. for, though elated by his rank, did not render him
supercilious; on contrary, he wasllttention everybody. by
natureoffensive, friendly,nd obliging, his presentationt st.
james's had made him courteous.

lady lucas was very good kind woman, noclever be
valuable neighbour mrs. bennet.y had several children. eldest
ofm, sensible,telligent young woman,bout twenty-seven, was
elizabeth'stimate friend.

that miss lucasesnd miss bennets should meet talk over
ball wasbsolutely necessary;nd morningfterssembly
brought former longbourn hearnd communicate.

“_you_ began evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet civil
self-commmiss lucas. “_you_ were mr. bingley's first choice.”

“yes; but he seemed like his second better.”

“oh! you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced her twice. be
sure that _did_ seems if hedmired her--indeed i rather believe he
_did_--i heard somethingbout--but i hardly know what--something
about mr. robinson.”

“perhaps you mean what i overheard between himnd mr. robinson; did not
i mention you? mr. robinson'ssking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies,nd whether he did not thinkre were great many
pretty women room,nd _which_ he thought prettiest?nd his
answering immediately last question: 'oh! eldest miss bennet,
beyond doubt;re cannot be two opinions on that point.'”

“upon my word! well, that is very decideddeed--that does seems
if--but, however, mayll come nothing, you know.”

“_my_ overhearings were more purpose than _yours_, eliza,” said
charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listenings his friend,
is he?--poeliza!--be only just _tolerable_.”

“i beg you would not putlizzy's head be vexed by his
ill-treatment, fhe is such disagreeable man, that would be quite
misfortune be liked by him. mrs. longld me last night that he
sat close her fhalf-an-hourout once opening his lips.”

“are you quite sure, ma'am?--is notre little mistake?” said jane.
“i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking her.”

“aye--because shesked himt last how he liked netherfield,nd he
could not helpnswering her; but she said he seemed quitengryt
being spoke.”

“miss bingleyld me,” said jane, “that he never speaks much,
unlessmong histimatecquaintances. _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.”

“i do not believe word, my dear. if he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked mrs. long. but i can guess how
was; everybody says that he is eat up pride,nd i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep carriage,nd had come
ball hack chaise.”

“i do not mind his not talking mrs. long,” said miss lucas, “but i
wish he had danced eliza.”

“another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance _him_,
if i were you.”

“i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ dance him.”

“his pride,” said miss lucas, “does notfend _me_ so muchs pride
often does, becausere isn excuse for. one cannot wonder that so
very fine young man, family, fortune, everything his favour,
should think highly himself. if i may so express, he has _right_
be proud.”

“that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”

“pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon solidity her
reflections, “is very common failing, i believe. byll that i have
ever read, im convinced that is very commondeed; that human
nature is particularly prone,nd thatrere very few us
who do not cherish feeling self-complacency on score some
quality other, real imaginary. vanitynd pridere different
things, though wordsreten used synonymously. person may
be proudout being vain. pride relates more our opinion
ourselves, vanity what we would have others think us.”

“if i weres richs mr. darcy,” cried young lucas, who came
his sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep pack
foxhounds,nd drink bottle wine day.”

“then you would drink great deal more than you ought,” said mrs.
bennet; “if i were see yout, i should takeway your bottle
directly.”

boy protested that she should not; she continued declare that she
would,ndrgument ended only visit.



chapter 6


ladies longbourn soon waited on those netherfield. visit
was soon returned due form. miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on
goodwill mrs. hurstnd miss bingley;nd though mother was
found betolerable,nd younger sisters not worth speaking,
wish being bettercquainted _them_ was expressedwards
two eldest. by jane,ttention was received greatest
pleasure, but elizabeth still saw superciliousnessir treatment
everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,nd could not likem;
thoughir kindness jane, suchs was, had valuesrising
all probability fromfluenceir brother'sdmiration.
was generally evident whenevery met, that he _did_dmire hernd
_her_ was equally evident that jane was yielding preference
which she had begun entertafhim from first,nd was
way be very much love; but she considered pleasure that
was not likely be discovered by world general, since jane
united, great strength feeling, composure tempernd
uniform cheerfulness manner which would guard her from suspicions
impertinent. she mentioned her friend miss lucas.

“may perhaps be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “beble impose
on public such case; but is sometimes disadvantage be
so very guarded. if woman conceals herffection same skill
from object, she may lose opportunity fixing him;nd
willn be but poconsolation believe world equally
dark.re is so much gratitude vanitylmost every
attachment, that is not safe leavenyself. we canll
_begin_ freely--slight preference is natural enough; butrere
very few us who have heart enough be really loveout
encouragement. nine cases out ten women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”

“but she does help him on,s muchs her nature willllow. if i can
perceive her regard fhim, he must be simpleton,deed, not
discovero.”

“remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's dispositions you do.”

“but if woman is partial man,nd does not endeavour conceal
it, he must find out.”

“perhaps he must, if he sees enough her. but, though bingleynd jane
meetlerablyten, is never fmany hoursgether;nd,sy
always see each other large mixed parties, is impossible that
every moment should be employed conversinggether. jane should
therefore make most every half-hour which she can commhis
attention. when she is secure him,re will be more leisure for
falling loves muchs she chooses.”

“your plan is good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is
question but desire being well married,nd if i were determined
get rich husband,ny husband, i dare say i shoulddopt. but
thesere not jane's feelings; she is notcting by design.s yet,
she cannot even be certadegree her own regard nofs
reasonableness. she has known him only fortnight. she danced four
dances himt meryton; she saw him one morningt his own house,
has since dined him company four times. is not quite
enough make her understhis character.”

“nots you represent. had she merely _dined_ him, she might
only have discovered whether he had goodppetite; but you must
remember that four evenings havelso been spentgether--four
evenings may do great deal.”

“yes;se four evenings have enabledmscertathaty
both like vingt-un better than commerce; but respectny other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”

“well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane successll my heart;nd
if she were married him-morrow, i should think she hads good
chance happinesss if she were be studying his character for
twelvemonth. happiness marriage is entirely matter chance. if

ever so similar beforehand, does notdvanceir felicity

haveir share vexation;nd is better knows littles
possible defects person whom youre pass your
life.”

“you make me laugh, charlotte; but is not sound. you know is not
sound,nd that you would neverct way yourself.”

occupied observing mr. bingley'sttentions her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becomingn object some
interest eyes his friend. mr. darcy hadt first scarcely
allowed her be pretty; he had lookedt heroutdmirationt
ball;nd wheny next met, he lookedt her only criticise. but no
sooner had he made clear himselfnd his friends that she hardly
had good feature her face, than he began find was rendered
uncommonlytelligent by beautiful expression her dark eyes.
discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had
detected critical eye more than one failure perfect symmetry
her form, he was forcedcknowledge her figure be lightnd
pleasing;nd spite hissserting that her manners were not those
fashionable world, he was caught byir easy playfulness.
she was perfectly unaware; her he was only man who made
himselfgreeable nowhere,nd who had not thought her handsome enough
dance.

he began wish know more her,nds stepwards conversing
her himself,ttended her conversation others. his doing so
drew her notice. wast sir william lucas's, where large party were
assembled.

“what does mr. darcy mean,” said she charlotte, “by listening my
conversation colonel forster?”

“that is question which mr. darcy only cannswer.”

“but if he doesny more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he isbout. he has very satirical eye,nd if i do not begby
being impertinent myself, i shall soon growfraid him.”

on hispproachingm soonfterwards, thoughout seeming have
anytention speaking, miss lucas defied her friend mention such
subject him; which immediately provoking elizabeth do, she
turned himnd said:

“did you not think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when i was teasing colonel forster give us ballt
meryton?”

“great energy; but islways subject which makes lady
energetic.”

“youre severe on us.”

“will be _her_ turn soon be teased,” said miss lucas. “im going
openstrument, eliza,nd you know what follows.”

“youre very strange creature by way friend!--always wanting me
playnd sing beforenybodynd everybody! if my vanity had taken
musical turn, you would have beenvaluable; buts is, i would
really rather not sdown before those who must be habof
hearing very best performers.” on miss lucas's persevering, however,
shedded, “very well, if must be so, must.”nd gravely glancing
at mr. darcy, “there is fine old saying, which everybody here is
course familiar: 'keep your breath cool your porridge';nd i
shall keep mine swell my song.”

her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.fter song
two,nd before she could reply entreaties several that
she would singgain, she was eagerly succeededtstrument by her
sister mary, who having, consequence being only plaone
family, worked hard fknowledgendccomplishments, waslways
impatient fdisplay.

mary had neither genius ntaste;nd though vanity had given her
application, had given her likewise pedanticirnd conceited
manner, which would havejured higher degree excellence than she
had reached. elizabeth, easynd unaffected, had been listened
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well;nd mary,t
end long concerto, was glad purchase praisend gratitude by
scotchnd irishirs,t request her younger sisters, who,
some lucases,nd two threeficers, joined eagerly
dancingt one end room.

mr. darcy stood nearm silentdignationt such mode
passing evening, exclusionll conversation,nd waso
much engrossed by his thoughts perceive that sir william lucas was
his neighbour, till sir william thus began:

“what charmingmusement fyoung people is, mr. darcy!re
is nothing like dancingfterll. i considers one first
refinements polished society.”

“certainly, sir;nd hasdvantagelso being voguemongst
less polished societies world. every savage can dance.”

sir william only smiled. “your friend performs delightfully,” he
continuedfter pause, on seeing bingley jogroup; “i doubt
not that yourendept science yourself, mr. darcy.”

“you saw me dancet meryton, i believe, sir.”

“yes,deed,nd received noconsiderable pleasure from sight. do
youten dancet st. james's?”

“never, sir.”

“do you not think would be proper compliment place?”

“is compliment which i never payny place if i canvoid.”

“you have housewn, i conclude?”

mr. darcy bowed.

“i had once had some thought fixingwn myself--fim fond
superisociety; but i did not feel quite certathatir
london wouldgree lady lucas.”

he paused hopesnnswer; but his companion was not disposed
makeny;nd elizabetht thatstant movingwardsm, he was
struckction doing very gallant thing,nd called out
her:

“my dear miss eliza, whyre you not dancing? mr. darcy, you mustllow
me present young lady yous very desirable partner. you
cannot refuse dance, im sure when so much beauty is before you.”
nd, taking her hand, he would have given mr. darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling receive, when shestantly
drew back,nd said some discomposure sir william:

“indeed, sir, i have not leasttention dancing. i entreat you
not suppose that i moved wayder beg fpartner.”

mr. darcy, grave propriety, requested bellowed honour
her hand, but vain. elizabeth was determined; ndid sir williamt
all shake her purpose by histtemptt persuasion.

“you excel so much dance, miss eliza, that is cruel deny
me happiness seeing you;nd though gentleman dislikes
amusement general, he can have no objection, im sure, oblige us
fone half-hour.”

“mr. darcy isll politeness,” said elizabeth, smiling.

“he is,deed; but, consideringducement, my dear miss eliza,
we cannot wondert his complaisance--fwho would object such
partner?”

elizabeth lookedrchly,nd turnedway. her resistance had not
injured her gentleman,nd he was thinking her some
complacency, when thusccosted by miss bingley:

“i can guess subject your reverie.”

“i should imagine not.”

“youre considering howsupportable would be pass many evenings
manner--such society;nddeed im quite your opinion.
i was never morennoyed!sipidity,nd yet noise--the
nothingness,nd yet self-importancell those people! what would
i give hear your strictures onm!”

“your conjecture istally wrong, issure you. my mind was more
agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on very great pleasure
which pair fine eyes face pretty woman can bestow.”

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face,nd desired he
would tell her what lady had credinspiring such reflections.
mr. darcy replied greattrepidity:

“miss elizabeth bennet.”

“miss elizabeth bennet!” repeated miss bingley. “imllstonishment.
how long has she been such favourite?--pray, whenm i wish you
joy?”

“that is exactly question which i expected yousk. lady's
imagination is very rapid; jumps fromdmiration love, from love
matrimony, moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy.”

“nay, if youre seriousbout, i shall consider matter is
absolutely settled. you will be having charming mother-in-law,deed;
and, course, she willlways bet pemberley you.”

he listened her perfectdifference while she chose

thatll was safe, her wflowed long.



chapter 7


mr. bennet's property consistedlmost entirelyn estate two
thousyear, which, unfortunately fhis daughters, was entailed,
default heirs male, on distant relation;ndir mother's
fortune, thoughmple fher situation life, could but ill supply
deficiency his. her father had beennttorney meryton,nd
had left her four thouspounds.

she had sister married mr. phillips, who had been clerk
their fathernd succeeded him business,nd brother settled
london respectable line trade.

village longbourn was only one mile from meryton; most
convenient distance fyoung ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three four times week, payir dutyiruntnd
milliner's shop just over way. two youngest family,
catherinend lydia, were particularly frequentsettentions;
their minds were more vacant thanir sisters',nd when nothing
betterfered, walk meryton was necessarymuseir morning
hoursnd furnish conversation fevening;nd however bare news

headquarters.

their visits mrs. phillips were now productive most
interestingtelligence. every daydded somethingir knowledge
officers' namesnd connections.ir lodgings were not long

phillips visitedmll,nd opened his nieces store
felicity unknown before.y could talk nothing butficers;nd
mr. bingley's large fortune, mention which gavenimation
toir mother, was worthlessir eyes when opposed
regimentalsn ensign.

after listening one morningir effusions on subject, mr.
bennet coolly observed:

“fromll that i can collect by your manner talking, you must be two
silliest girls country. i have suspected some time, but
im now convinced.”

catherine was disconcerted,nd made nonswer; but lydia, perfect
indifference, continued express herdmiration captacarter,
her hope seeing him course day,s he was going
next morning london.

“imstonished, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “that you should be so
ready think your own children silly. if i wished think slightingly
ofnybody's children, should not be my own, however.”

“if my childrenre silly, i must hope belways sensible.”

“yes--buts happens,yrellm very clever.”

“is only point, i flatter myself, on which we do notgree. i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided every particular, but i must
so far differ from yous think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”

“my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls have sense
their fathernd mother. wheny get ourge, i dare sayy will
not thinkboutficersny more than we do. i remember time when
i liked red coat myself very well--and,deed, so i do stillt my
heart;nd if smart young colonel, five six thousyear,
should want one my girls i shall not say nay him;nd i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming other nightt sir william's
his regimentals.”

“mamma,” cried lydia, “myunt says that colonel forsternd captain
carter do not go soten miss watson'ssy did wheny first
came; she seesm now veryten standing clarke's library.”

mrs. bennet was prevented replying by entrance footman
note fmiss bennet; came from netherfield,nd servant waited
fornnswer. mrs. bennet's eyes sparkled pleasure,nd she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

“well, jane, who is from? what isbout? what does he say? well,
jane, make hastend tell us; make haste, my love.”

“is from miss bingley,” said jane,ndn readloud.

“my dear friend,--

“caroline bingley”

“officers!” cried lydia. “i wonder myunt did not tell us
_that_.”

“dining out,” said mrs. bennet, “that is very unlucky.”

“can i have carriage?” said jane.

“no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because seems likely
rain;ndn you must stayll night.”

“that would be good scheme,” said elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would notfer send her home.”

“oh! but gentlemen will have mr. bingley's chaise go meryton,
hursts have no horsesirs.”

“i had much rather go coach.”

“but, my dear, your father cannot spare horses, im sure.yre
wanted farm, mr. bennet,rey not?”

“theyre wanted farm muchtener than i can getm.”

“but if you have gotm-day,” said elizabeth, “my mother's purpose
will benswered.”

she didt last extort from her fatherncknowledgment that horses
were engaged. jane wasrefore obliged go on horseback,nd her
motherttended her domany cheerful prognostics
bad day. her hopes werenswered; jane had not been gone long before
rained hard. her sisters were uneasy fher, but her mother was
delighted. racontinued whole eveningouttermission;
jane certainly could not come back.

“was lucky idemine,deed!” said mrs. bennet more than
once,s if credmaking rawerell her own. till
next morning, however, she was notwarell felicity her
contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when servant from netherfield
brought following note felizabeth:

“my dearest lizzy,--

“i find myself very unwell morning, which, i suppose, is be
imputed my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will not
hear my returning till im better.ysistlso on my seeing mr.
jones--therefore do not belarmed if you should hear his having been
me--and, excepting sore throatnd headache,re is not much
matter me.--yours, etc.”

“well, my dear,” said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read note
aloud, “if your daughter should have dangerous fillness--if she
should die, would be comfort know that wasll pursuof
mr. bingley,nd under yourders.”

“oh! im notfraid her dying. people do not die little trifling
colds. she will be taken good care.s longs she staysre, is
all very well. i would gond see her if i could have carriage.”

elizabeth, feeling reallynxious, was determined go her, though
carriage was not be had;nds she was no horsewoman, walking
was her onlylternative. she declared her resolution.

“how can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as think such
thing,ll dirt! you will not be fbe seen when you get
there.”

“i shall be very fsee jane--which isll i want.”

“is hint me, lizzy,” said her father, “send for
horses?”

“no,deed, i do not wishvoid walk. distance is nothing
when one has motive; only three miles. i shall be back by dinner.”

“idmirectivity your benevolence,” observed mary, “but every
impulse feeling should be guided by reason;nd, my opinion,
exertion shouldlways be proportion what is required.”

“we will gos fars meryton you,” said catherinend lydia.
elizabethcceptedir company,nd three young ladies setf
together.

“if we make haste,” said lydia,sy walkedlong, “perhaps we may
see something captacarter before he goes.”

merytony parted; two youngest repaired lodgings one
officers' wives,nd elizabeth continued her walklone, crossing
fieldfter fieldt quick pace, jumping over stilesnd springing
over puddles impatientctivity,nd finding herselft last
withview house, wearynkles, dirty stockings,nd face
glowing warmth exercise.

she was shownbreakfast-parlour, wherell but jane were
assembled,nd where herppearance created great deal surprise.
that she should have walked three miles so early day, such
dirty weather,nd by herself, waslmostcredible mrs. hurstnd
miss bingley;nd elizabeth was convinced thaty held her contempt
for. she was received, however, very politely bym;ndir
brother's mannersre was something better than politeness;re
was good humournd kindness. mr. darcy said very little,nd mr.
hurst nothingtll. former was divided betweendmiration
brilliancy which exercise had given her complexion,nd doubts
occasion's justifying her coming so farlone. latter was
thinking only his breakfast.

herquiriesfter her sister were not very favourablynswered. miss
bennet had slept ill,nd though up, was very feverish,nd not
well enough leave her room. elizabeth was glad be taken her
immediately;nd jane, who had only beenheld by fear giving
alarmconvenience from expressing her note how much she longed
fsuch visit, was delightedt her entrance. she was not equal,
however, much conversation,nd when miss bingley leftm
together, couldttempt little besides expressions gratitude for
extraordinary kindness she was treated. elizabeth silentlyttended
her.

when breakfast was overy were joined by sisters;nd elizabeth
began likem herself, when she saw how muchffectionnd
solicitudey showed fjane.pothecary came,nd having
examined his patient, said,s might be supposed, that she had caught
violent cold,nd thaty must endeavour get better;
advised her return bed,nd promised her some draughts.dvice
was followed readily, ffeverish symptomscreased,nd her head
achedcutely. elizabeth did not quher room fmoment; nwere
other ladiestenbsent; gentlemen being out,y had,
fact, nothing do elsewhere.

when clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go,nd very
unwillingly said so. miss bingleyfered her carriage,nd she only
wanted little pressingccept, when jane testified such concern
parting her, that miss bingley was obliged convertfer
chaisenvitation remaint netherfield fpresent.
elizabeth most thankfully consented,nd servant was dispatched

chapter 8


at five o'clock two ladies retired dress,ndt half-past six
elizabeth was summoned dinner. civilquiries whichn
poured,ndmongst which she had pleasure distinguishing
much superisolicitude mr. bingley's, she could not make very
favourablenswer. jane was by no means better. sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three four times how muchy were grieved, how
shocking was have bad cold,nd how excessivelyy disliked
being illmselves;ndn thought no more matter:ndir
indifferencewards jane when not immediately beforem restored
elizabeth enjoymentll her former dislike.

their brother,deed, was only one party whom she could
regardny complacency. hisnxiety fjane was evident,nd his
attentions herself most pleasing,ndy prevented her feeling
herself so muchntruders she believed she was considered by
others. she had very little notice fromny but him. miss bingley was
engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so;nds fmr.
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he wasndolent man, who lived only
eat, drink,nd playt cards; who, when he found her prefer plain
dish ragout, had nothing say her.

when dinner was over, she returned directly jane,nd miss bingley
beganbusing hers soons she was out room. her manners were
pronounced be very baddeed, mixture pridend impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. mrs. hurst thought
same,nddded:

“she has nothing, short, recommend her, but beingn excellent
walker. i shall never forget herppearance morning. she really
lookedlmost wild.”

“she did,deed, louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. very
nonsensical cometll! why must _she_ be scamperingbout
country, because her sister had cold? her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”

“yes,nd her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, sixches deep
mud, imbsolutely certain;nd gown which had been let down
hide not doingsfice.”

“your picture may be very exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but was
all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she cameroom morning. her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.”

“_you_ observed, mr. darcy, im sure,” said miss bingley; “im
inclined think that you would not wish see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition.”

“certainly not.”

“walk three miles, four miles, five miles, whatever is,
above hernkles dirt,ndlone, quitelone! what could she mean by
it? seems me shownbominable sort conceiteddependence,
most country-towndifference decorum.”

“showsnffection fher sister that is very pleasing,” said
bingley.

“imfraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley half whisper, “that
thisdventure has ratherffected yourdmiration her fine eyes.”

“nottll,” he replied; “they were brightened by exercise.”
short pause followed speech,nd mrs. hurst begangain:

“i haven excessive regard fmiss jane bennet, she is really very
sweet girl,nd i wishll my heart she were well settled. but
such fathernd mother,nd such low connections, imfraidre is
no chance.”

“i think i have heard you say thatir uncle isnttorney
meryton.”

“yes;ndy havenother, who lives somewhere near cheapside.”

“that is capital,”dded her sister,ndy both laughed heartily.

“ify had uncles enough fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it
would not makem one jot lessgreeable.”

“but must very materially lessenir chance marrying menny
consideration world,” replied darcy.

speech bingley made nonswer; but his sisters gaveir
heartyssent,nddulgedir mirth fsome timet expense
their dear friend's vulgar relations.

renewal tenderness, however,y returned her room on
leaving dining-parlour,nd sat her till summoned coffee.
she was still very poorly,nd elizabeth would not quhertll, till
late evening, when she had comfort seeing her sleep,nd
when seemed her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. on entering drawing-room she found whole
partyt loo,nd was immediatelyvited joinm; but suspecting
them be playing high she declined,nd making her sister
excuse, said she wouldmuse herself fshort time she could stay
below, book. mr. hurst lookedt herstonishment.

“do you prefer reading cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”

“miss elizbennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards. she is great
reader,nd has no pleasurenything else.”

“i deserve neither such praise nsuch censure,” cried elizabeth; “im
_not_ great reader,nd i have pleasure many things.”

“nursing your sister im sure you have pleasure,” said bingley; “and
i hope will be sooncreased by seeing her quite well.”

elizabeth thanked him from her heart,ndn walkedwards
table where few books were lying. he immediatelyfered fetch her
others--all that his libraryfforded.

“i wish my collection were larger fyour benefitnd my own
credit; but imn idle fellow,nd though i have not many, i have more
than i ever lookedto.”

elizabethssured him that she could suherself perfectly those
room.

“imstonished,” said miss bingley, “that my father should have left
so small collection books. what delightful library you havet
pemberley, mr. darcy!”

“ought be good,” he replied, “has been work many
generations.”

“then you havedded so much yourself, yourelways buying
books.”

“i cannot comprehend neglect family library such dayss
these.”

“neglect! im sure you neglect nothing that candd beauties
that noble place. charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish may be
halfs delightfuls pemberley.”

“i wish may.”

“but i would reallydvise you make your purchase that
neighbourhood,nd take pemberley fkind model.re is not
finer county englthan derbyshire.”

“withll my heart; i will buy pemberleyself if darcy will sell.”

“im talking possibilities, charles.”

“upon my word, caroline, i should think more possible get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”

elizabeth was so much caught what passed,s leave her very
littlettention fher book;nd soon laying whollyside, she drew
near card-table,nd stationed herself between mr. bingleynd his
eldest sister, observe game.

“is miss darcy much grown since spring?” said miss bingley; “will
she bes talls im?”

“i think she will. she is nowbout miss elizabeth bennet's height,
rather taller.”

“how i long see hergain! i never metnybody who delighted me
so much. such countenance, such manners!nd so extremelyccomplished
fherge! her performance on pianoforte is exquisite.”

“ismazing me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
be so veryccomplishedsyllre.”

“all young ladiesccomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?”

“yes,llm, i think.yll paint tables, cover screens,nd
net purses. i scarcely knownyone who cannot doll,nd im sure
i never heard young lady spoken ffirst time,out being
informed that she was veryccomplished.”

“your list common extentccomplishments,” said darcy, “has
too much truth. word ispplied many woman who deserves no
otherwise than by netting purse covering screen. but im very
far fromgreeing you your estimation ladies general. i
cannot boast knowing more than half-a-dozen, whole range my
acquaintance, thatre reallyccomplished.”

“ni, im sure,” said miss bingley.

“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend great deal your
ideofnccomplished woman.”

“yes, i do comprehend great deal.”

“oh! certainly,” cried his faithfulssistant, “no one can be really
esteemedccomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. woman must have thorough knowledge music, singing, drawing,
dancing,nd modern languages, deserve word;nd besides
all, she must possess certasomething herirnd manner
walking,ne her voice, herddressnd expressions, word
will be but half-deserved.”

“all she must possess,”dded darcy, “toll she must
yetdd something more substantial, improvement her mind by
extensive reading.”

“im no longer surprisedt your knowing _only_ sixccomplished women.
i rather wonder nowt your knowing _any_.”

“are you so severe upon your own sexs doubt possibilityll
this?”

“i never saw such woman. i never saw such capacity,nd taste,nd

“is one those young ladies who seek recommendmselves
other sex by undervaluingir own;nd many men, i dare say,

“undoubtedly,” replied darcy, whom remark was chieflyddressed,

despicable.”

chapter 9


elizabeth passed chief night her sister's room,nd
morning had pleasure beingble sendlerablenswer
inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by housemaid,
some timefterwards from two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. spitemendment, however, she requested have
note sent longbourn, desiring her mother visjane,nd form her
own judgement her situation. note was immediately dispatched,nd
its contentss quickly complied. mrs. bennet,ccompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soonfter family breakfast.

had she found janenypparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
notlarming, she had no wish her recovering immediately,s her
restoration health would probably remove her from netherfield. she
would not listen,refore, her daughter's proposal being carried
home; neither didpothecary, whorrivedbout same time, think
ittlldvisable.fter sitting little while jane, on miss
bingley'sppearancendvitation, mothernd three daughtersll
attended herbreakfast parlour. bingley metm hopes
that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.

“indeed i have, sir,” was hernswer. “she is great dealo ill be
moved. mr. jones says we must not think moving her. we must trespass
little longer on your kindness.”

“removed!” cried bingley. “must not be thought. my sister, im
sure, will not hear her removal.”

“you may depend upon, madam,” said miss bingley, cold civility,
“that miss bennet will receive every possiblettention while she
remains us.”

mrs. bennet was profuse hercknowledgments.

“im sure,” shedded, “if was not fsuch good friends i do not
know what would become her, fshe is very illdeed,nd suffers
vast deal, though greatest patience world, which is
always way her, fshe has,out exception, sweetest
temper i have ever met. iten tell my other girlsyre
nothing _her_. you have sweet room here, mr. bingley,nd
charming prospect over gravel walk. i do not know place
country that is equal netherfield. you will not think quitting
hurry, i hope, though you have but short lease.”

“whatever i do is done hurry,” replied he; “therefore if i
should resolve qunetherfield, i should probably bef five
minutes.t present, however, i consider myselfs quite fixed here.”

“that is exactly what i should have supposed you,” said elizabeth.

“you begcomprehend me, do you?” cried he, turningwards her.

“oh! yes--i understyou perfectly.”

“i wish i might take fcompliment; but be so easily seen
through imfraid is pitiful.”

“that iss happens. does not follow that deep,tricate
character is more less estimable than such ones yours.”

“lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where youre,nd do not run on
wild manner that youre suffered dot home.”

“i did not know before,” continued bingley immediately, “that you were
studier character. must benmusing study.”

“yes, buttricate charactersre _most_musing.y havet
least thatdvantage.”

“country,” said darcy, “can general supply but few subjects for
such study. country neighbourhood you move very confinednd
unvarying society.”

“but peoplemselveslter so much, thatre is something new be
observedm fever.”

“yes,deed,” cried mrs. bennet,fended by his manner mentioning
country neighbourhood. “issure youre is quites much _that_
going on countryswn.”

everybody was surprised,nd darcy,fter lookingt her fmoment,
turned silentlyway. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

“i cannot see that london hasny greatdvantage over country, for
my part, except shopsnd public places. country is vast deal
pleasanter, is not, mr. bingley?”

“when im country,” he replied, “i never wish leave;
when imwn is pretty much same.y have eachir
advantages,nd i can be equally happy either.”

“aye--that is because you have right disposition. but that
gentleman,” lookingt darcy, “seemed think country was nothing
atll.”

“indeed, mamma, youre mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing fher
mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant thatre was not
such variety people be met countryswn,
which you mustcknowledge be true.”

“certainly, my dear, nobody saidre were; buts not meeting
many people neighbourhood, i believerere few
neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine four-and-twenty families.”

nothing but concern felizabeth could enable bingley keep his
countenance. his sister was less delicate,nd directed her eyeswards
mr. darcy very expressive smile. elizabeth, fsake
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, nowsked her if
charlotte lucas had beent longbourn since _her_ comingway.

“yes, she called yesterday her father. whatngreeable man sir
william is, mr. bingley, is not he? so much man fashion! so
genteelnd easy! he haslways something say everybody. _that_
is my idegood breeding;nd those persons who fancymselves very
important,nd never openir mouths, quite mistake matter.”

“did charlotte dine you?”

“no, she would go home. i fancy she was wantedbout mince-pies. for
my part, mr. bingley, ilways keep servants that can doir own work;
_my_ daughtersre brought up very differently. but everybody is
judge formselves,nd lucasesre very good sort girls,
issure you. is pityyre not handsome! not that i think
charlotte so _very_ plain--butn she is our particular friend.”

“she seems very pleasant young woman.”

“oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself
hasten said so,nd envied me jane's beauty. i do not like boast
my own child, but be sure, jane--one does notten seenybody
better looking. is what everybody says. i do not trust my own
partiality. when she was only fifteen,re was mant my brother
gardiner'swn so much love her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make hernfer before we cameway. but, however, he
did not. perhaps he thought hero young. however, he wrote some verses
on her,nd very prettyy were.”

“so ended hisffection,” said elizabeth impatiently. “there has
been many one, i fancy, overcome same way. i wonder who first
discovered efficacy poetry drivingway love!”

“i have been used consider poetrys _food_ love,” said darcy.

“fine, stout, healthy love may. everything nourishes what is
stronglready. but if be only slight, thsortclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve entirelyway.”

darcy only smiled;nd general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herselfgain. she longed
speak, but could think nothing say;ndfter short silence mrs.
bennet began repeating her thanks mr. bingley fhis kindness
jane,npology ftroubling himlso lizzy. mr. bingley was
unaffectedly civil hisnswer,nd forced his younger sister be
civillso,nd say what occasion required. she performed her part
indeedout much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied,nd
soonfterwardsdered her carriage. upon signal, youngest
her daughters put herself forward. two girls had been whispering
each other during whole visit,nd result was, that
youngest should tax mr. bingley having promised on his first coming
incountry give ballt netherfield.

lydiwas stout, well-grown girl fifteen, fine complexion
good-humoured countenance; favourite her mother, whose
affection had brought herpublictn earlyge. she had high
animal spirits,nd sort natural self-consequence, which
attentionficers, whom her uncle's good dinners,nd her own
easy manners recommended her, hadcreasedtossurance. she was very
equal,refore,ddress mr. bingley on subject ball,nd
abruptly reminded him his promise;dding, that would be most
shameful thing world if he did not keep. hisnswer
suddenttack was delightfulir mother's ear:

“im perfectly ready, issure you, keep my engagement;nd when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name very day
ball. but you would not wish be dancing when she is ill.”

lydideclared herself satisfied. “oh! yes--would be much better
watill jane was well,nd by that time most likely captacarter
would bet merytongain.nd when you have given _your_ ball,” she
added, “i shallsist onir giving onelso. i shall tell colonel
forster will be quite shame if he does not.”

mrs. bennetnd her daughtersn departed,nd elizabeth returned
instantly jane, leaving her ownnd her relations' behaviour
remarks two ladiesnd mr. darcy; latter whom, however,
could not be prevailed on joinir censure _her_, spite
all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.



chapter 10


day passed muchs day before had done. mrs. hurstnd miss
bingley had spent some hours morningvalid, who
continued, though slowly, mend;nd evening elizabeth joined
their party drawing-room. loo-table, however, did notppear.
mr. darcy was writing,nd miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
progress his letternd repeatedly callingf histtention by
messages his sister. mr. hurstnd mr. bingley weret piquet,nd
mrs. hurst was observingir game.

elizabethok up some needlework,nd was sufficientlymused
attending what passed between darcynd his companion. perpetual
commendations lady, either on his handwriting, on evenness
his lines, on length his letter, perfect unconcern
which her praises were received, formed curious dialogue,nd was
exactly union her opinion each.

“how delighted miss darcy will be receive such letter!”

he made nonswer.

“you write uncommonly fast.”

“youre mistaken. i write rather slowly.”

“how many letters you must have occasion write course
year! letters business,o! how odious i should thinkm!”

“is fortunate,n, thaty fall my lotstead yours.”

“pray tell your sister that i long see her.”

“i havelreadyld her so once, by your desire.”

“imfraid you do not like your pen. let me mend fyou. i mend
pens remarkably well.”

“thank you--but ilways mend my own.”

“how can you contrive write so even?”

he was silent.

“tell your sister im delighted hear her improvement on harp;
pray let her know that im quite raptures her beautiful
little design ftable,nd i thinkfinitely superimiss
grantley's.”

“will you give me leave defer your raptures till i writegain?t
present i have not room dom justice.”

“oh! is no consequence. i shall see her january. but do you
always write such charming long letters her, mr. darcy?”

“theyre generally long; but whetherlways charming is not fme
determine.”

“is rule me, that person who can write long letter
ease, cannot write ill.”

“that will not do fcompliment darcy, caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write ease. he studieso much for
words four syllables. do not you, darcy?”

“my style writing is very different from yours.”

“oh!” cried miss bingley, “charles writes most careless way
imaginable. he leaves out half his words,nd blots rest.”

“my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time expressm--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideastll my correspondents.”

“your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”

“nothing is more deceitful,” said darcy, “thanppearance
humility. isten only carelessness opinion,nd sometimesn
indirect boast.”

“which two do you call _my_ little recent piece modesty?”

“indirect boast; fyoure really proud your defects
writing, because you considerms proceeding from rapidity
thoughtnd carelessness execution, which, if not estimable, you
thinkt least highlyteresting. power doingnything
quickness islways prized much by possessor,ndtenoutny
attention imperfection performance. when yould mrs.
bennet morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield
you should be gone five minutes, you meant be sort
panegyric, compliment yourself--yet what isre so very
laudable precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone,nd can be no realdvantage yourselfnyone else?”

“nay,” cried bingley, “iso much, remembert nightll
foolish things that were said morning.nd yet, upon my honour,
i believe what i said myself be true,nd i believet
moment.t least,refore, i did notssume character needless
precipitance merely showf before ladies.”

“i dare say you believed; but im by no means convinced that
you would be gone such celerity. your conduct would be quites
dependent on chances thatny man i know;nd if,s you were
mounting your horse, friend were say, 'bingley, you had better
stay till next week,' you would probably do, you would probably not
go--andtnother word, might stay month.”

“you have only proved by,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did
not do justice his own disposition. you have shown himf now much
more than he did himself.”

“im exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by your converting what my
friend sayscompliment on sweetness my temper. but im
afraid youre giving turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; fhe would certainly think better me, if under such
circumstance i were give flat denial,nd ridefs fasts i
could.”

“would mr. darcyn consider rashness youriginaltentions
astoned fby your obstinacydhering?”

“upon my word, i cannot exactly explamatter; darcy must speak for
himself.”

“you expect meccount fopinions which you choose call mine,
but which i have nevercknowledged.llowing case, however,
standccording your representation, you must remember, miss bennet,
that friend who is supposed desire his return house,nd
delay his plan, has merely desired,skedoutfering
onergument favours propriety.”

“yield readily--easily--_persuasion_ friend is no merit
you.”

“yieldout conviction is no compliment understanding
either.”

“youppear me, mr. darcy,llow nothing finfluence
friendshipndffection. regard frequester wouldten make
one readily yield request,out waiting forrguments reason
oneto. im not particularly speaking such cases you have
supposedbout mr. bingley. we mays well wait, perhaps, till
circumstance occurs before we discuss discretion his behaviour
thereupon. but generalnddinary cases between friendnd friend,
where onem is desired by other change resolution no
very great moment, should you think ill that person fcomplying
desire,out waiting berguedto?”

“will not bedvisable, before we proceed on subject,
arrange rather more precision degree importance which is
appertarequest,s wells degreetimacy subsisting
between parties?”

“byll means,” cried bingley; “let us hearll particulars, not
forgettingir comparative heightnd size; fthat will have more
weightrgument, miss bennet, than you may beware. issure
you, that if darcy were not such great tall fellow, comparison
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not
know morewful object than darcy, on particular occasions,nd
particular places;t his own house especially,nd sunday evening,
when he has nothing do.”

mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
ratherfended,ndrefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly
resenteddignity he had received,n expostulation her
brother ftalking such nonsense.

“i see your design, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislikenrgument,
want silence.”

“perhaps i do.rgumentsreo much like disputes. if yound miss
bennet will defer yours till im out room, i shall be very
thankful;ndn you may say whatever you like me.”

“what yousk,” said elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side;nd mr.
darcy had much better finish his letter.”

mr. darcyok herdvice,nd did finish his letter.

when that business was over, hepplied miss bingleynd elizabeth
forndulgence some music. miss bingley moved somelacrity
pianoforte;nd,fter polite request that elizabeth would lead
way which others politelynd more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

mrs. hurst sang her sister,nd whiley were thus employed,
elizabeth could not help observing,s she turned over some music-books
that lay onstrument, how frequently mr. darcy's eyes were fixed
on her. she hardly knew how suppose that she could ben object
admiration so great man;nd yet that he should lookt her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. she could only imagine,
however,t last that she drew his notice becausere was something
more wrongnd reprehensible,ccording his ideas right, than
any other person present. supposition did not paher. she liked
himo little care fhispprobation.

after playing somealian songs, miss bingley varied charm by
lively scotchir;nd soonfterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
elizabeth, said her:

“do not you feel greatclination, miss bennet, seize suchn
opportunity dancing reel?”

she smiled, but made nonswer. he repeated question, some
surpriset her silence.

“oh!” said she, “i heard you before, but i could not immediately
determine what say reply. you wanted me, i know, say 'yes,'
that you might have pleasure despising my taste; but ilways
delight overthrowing those kind schemes,nd cheating person
their premeditated contempt. i have,refore, made up my mind tell
you, that i do not want dance reeltll--now despise me if
you dare.”

“indeed i do not dare.”

elizabeth, having rather expectedffront him, wasmazedt his
gallantry; butre was mixture sweetnessndrchness her
manner which made difficult fherffrontnybody;nd darcy
had never been so bewitched byny womans he was by her. he really
believed, that were not finferiority her connections, he
should be some danger.

miss bingley saw, suspected enough be jealous;nd her great
anxiety frecovery her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire getting rid elizabeth.

sheten tried provoke darcydisliking her guest, by talking
their supposed marriage,nd planning his happiness suchnlliance.

“i hope,” said she,sy were walkinggether shrubbery
next day, “you will give your mother-in-law few hints, when
desirable event takes place,sdvantage holding herngue;
if you can compass, do cure younger girls runningfter
officers.nd, if i may mention so delicate subject, endeavour
check that little something, bordering on conceitnd impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”

“have younything else propose fmy domestic felicity?”

“oh! yes. do let portraits your unclendunt phillips be placed
galleryt pemberley. putm next your great-uncle
judge.yre same profession, you know, only different
lines.s fyour elizabeth's picture, you must not have taken, for
what painter could do justice those beautiful eyes?”

“would not be easy,deed, catchir expression, butir
colournd shape,nd eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”

at that momenty were met fromnother walk by mrs. hurstnd
elizabeth herself.

“i did not know that youtended walk,” said miss bingley, some
confusion, lesty had been overheard.

“you used usbominably ill,”nswered mrs. hurst, “runningwayout
telling us that you were coming out.”

then taking disengagedrm mr. darcy, she left elizabeth walk
by herself. path justdmitted three. mr. darcy feltir rudeness,
immediately said:

“walk is not wide enough four party. we had better goto
avenue.”

but elizabeth, who had not leastclination remainm,
laughinglynswered:

“no, no; stay where youre. youre charmingly grouped,ndppear
uncommondvantage. picturesque would be spoilt bydmitting
fourth. good-bye.”

shen ran gailyf, rejoicings she rambledbout, hope
beingt homegaday two. jane waslready so much recovered
astend leaving her room fcouple hours that evening.



chapter 11


when ladies removedfter dinner, elizabeth ran up her
sister,nd seeing her well guarded from cold,ttended herto
drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends many
professions pleasure;nd elizabeth had never seenm sogreeable
asy were during hour which passed before gentlemenppeared.
their powers conversation were considerable.y could describen
entertainmentccuracy, relatennecdote humour,nd laugh
atircquaintance spirit.

but when gentlemen entered, jane was no longer first object;
miss bingley's eyes werestantly turnedward darcy,nd she had
something say him before he haddvanced many steps. heddressed
himself miss bennet, polite congratulation; mr. hurstlso
made her slight bow,nd said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
warmth remained fbingley's salutation. he was full joynd
attention. first half-hour was spent piling up fire, lest she
should suffer from change room;nd she removedt his desire
other side fireplace, that she might be further from
door. hen sat down by her,nd talked scarcelynyone
else. elizabeth,t work opposite corner, sawll great
delight.

when tewas over, mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law
card-table--but vain. she had obtained privatetelligence that mr.
darcy did not wish fcards;nd mr. hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. shessured him that no onetended play,nd
silence whole party on subject seemed justify her. mr.
hurst hadrefore nothing do, but stretch himself on one
sofasnd go sleep. darcyok up book; miss bingley did same;
mrs. hurst, principally occupied playing her bracelets
rings, joined nowndn her brother's conversation miss
bennet.

miss bingley'sttention was quites much engaged watching mr.
darcy's progress through _his_ book,s reading her own;nd she
was perpetually either making somequiry, lookingt his page. she
could not whim, however,ny conversation; he merelynswered her
question,nd read on.t length, quite exhausted byttempt be
amused her own book, which she had only chosen because was
second volume his, she gave great yawnnd said, “how pleasant
is spendn evening way! i declarefterllre is no
enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tiresnything than
book! when i have house my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library.”

no one madeny reply. shen yawnedgain, threwside her book,nd
cast her eyes round room quest fsomemusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning ball miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards himnd said:

“by bye, charles,re you really serious meditating dancet
netherfield? i woulddvise you, before you determine on, consult
wishes present party; im much mistaken ifrere
not somemong us whom ball would be rather punishment than
pleasure.”

“if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go bed, if he
chooses, before begins--buts fball, is quite settled
thing;nds soons nicholls has made white soup enough, i shall send
round my cards.”

“i should like ballsfinitely better,” she replied, “ify were
carried on different manner; butre is somethingsufferably
tedious usual process such meeting. would surely be much
more rational if conversationstead dancing were madeder
day.”

“much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but would not be
near so much like ball.”

miss bingley made nonswer,nd soonfterwards she got upnd walked
about room. her figure was elegant,nd she walked well; but
darcy,t whom wasllimed, was stillflexibly studious.
desperation her feelings, she resolved on one effort more,nd,
turning elizabeth, said:

“miss elizbennet, let me persuade you follow my example,nd take
turnbout room. issure you is very refreshingfter sitting so
long onettitude.”

elizabeth was surprised, butgreed immediately. miss bingley
succeeded no less real object her civility; mr. darcy looked
up. he wass muchwake noveltyttention that quarters
elizabeth herself could be,nd unconsciously closed his book. he was
directlyvited joinir party, but he declined, observing that
he could imagine but two motives forir choosing walk upnd down
roomgether, either which motives his joiningm would
interfere. “what could he mean? she was dying know what could be his
meaning?”--andsked elizabeth whether she couldtll understhim?

“nottll,” was hernswer; “but depend upon, he means be severe
on us,nd our surest way disappointing him will besk nothing
about.”

miss bingley, however, wascapable disappointing mr. darcy
anything,nd perseveredrefore requiringn explanation his
two motives.

“i have not smallest objection explainingm,” said he,s soon
as shellowed him speak. “you either choose method passing
evening because youre each other's confidence,nd have secret
affairs discuss, because youre conscious that your figures
appear greatestdvantage walking; if first, i would be
completely your way,nd if second, i candmire you much better
as i sby fire.”

“oh! shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heardnything so
abominable. how shall we punish him fsuch speech?”

“nothing so easy, if you have butclination,” said elizabeth. “we
canll plaguend punish onenother. tease him--laught him.timate
as youre, you must know how is be done.”

“but upon my honour, i do _not_. i dossure you that mytimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. tease calmness mannernd presence
mind! no, no; i feel he may defy usre.nds laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, byttempting laughout
subject. mr. darcy may hug himself.”

“mr. darcy is not be laughedt!” cried elizabeth. “that isn
uncommondvantage,nd uncommon i hope will continue, fwould
be great loss _me_ have many suchcquaintances. i dearly love
laugh.”

“miss bingley,” said he, “has given me more credthan can be.
wisestnd best men--nay, wisestnd bestir
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by person whose first object
life is joke.”

“certainly,” replied elizabeth--“therere such people, but i hope i
am not one _them_. i hope i never ridicule what is wisend good.
folliesnd nonsense, whimsndconsistencies, _do_ divert me, i own,
i laughtm whenever i can. butse, i suppose,re precisely
what youreout.”

“perhaps that is not possible fornyone. but has been study
my lifevoid those weaknesses whichten expose strong
understanding ridicule.”

“suchs vanitynd pride.”

“yes, vanity is weaknessdeed. but pride--wherere is real
superiority mind, pride will belways under good regulation.”

elizabeth turnedway hide smile.

“your examination mr. darcy is over, i presume,” said miss bingley;
“pray what is result?”

“im perfectly convinced by that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns
himselfout disguise.”

“no,” said darcy, “i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough,
butyre not, i hope, understanding. my temper i dare not vouch
for. is, i believe,o little yielding--certainlyo little for
convenience world. i cannot forget folliesnd vices others
so soons i ought, norirfensesgainst myself. my feelings
are not puffedbout everyttempt movem. my temper
would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost, is lost
forever.”

_is_ shade character. but you have chosen your fault well. i
really cannot _laugh_t. youre safe from me.”

“there is, i believe, every disposition tendency some particular
evil--natural defect, which not even best education can overcome.”

“_your_ defect is hate everybody.”

“yours,” he replied smile, “is willfully misunderstand

“do let us have little music,” cried miss bingley, tired
conversation which she had no share. “louisa, you will not mind my

her daughters remainingt netherfield till following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself receive
them pleasure before. hernswer,refore, was not propitious,t

bennet sentm word thaty could not possibly have carriage
before tuesday;nd her postscript wasdded, that if mr. bingley
his sister pressedm stay longer, she could sparem
very well.gainst staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--ndid she much expect would besked;nd fearful, on
contrary,s being consideredstrudingmselves needlessly long,
she urged jane borrow mr. bingley's carriage immediately,ndt
length was settled thatiriginal design leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned,nd request made.

communication excited many professions concern;nd enough was
said wishingm stayt least till following day work
on jane;nd till morrowir going was deferred. miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed delay, fher jealousynd dislike
one sister much exceeded herffection fother.

safe fher--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself be right.

mr. darcy was welcometelligence--elizabeth had beent
netherfield long enough. shettracted him more than he liked--miss
bingley was uncivil _her_,nd more teasing than usual himself.
he wisely resolved be particularly careful that no signdmiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her hope
influencing his felicity; sensible that if suchn idehad been
suggested, his behaviour during last day must have material weight
confirming crushing. steady his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words her through whole saturday,nd thoughy were
at one time left bymselves fhalf-an-hour, hedhered most
conscientiously his book,nd would not even lookt her.

pray do not talk that odious man. i do think is hardest thing
world, that your estate should be entailedway from your own
children;nd im sure, if i had been you, i should have tried longgo
do something otherbout.”

janend elizabeth tried explaher naturen entail.y

“certainly is mostiquitousffair,” said mr. bennet, “and
nothing can clear mr. collins from guiltheriting longbourn.
but if you will listen his letter, you may perhaps be little
softened by his manner expressing himself.”

“no, that im sure i shall not;nd i think is very impertinent
him write youtll,nd very hypocritical. i hate such false
friends. why could he not keep on quarreling you,s his father did
before him?”

astonished her husbandnd daughters.

mr. collins was punctual his time,nd was received great
politeness by whole family. mr. bennetdeed said little; but
ladies were ready enough talk,nd mr. collins seemed neither
need encouragement, ninclined be silent himself. he was
tall, heavy-looking young man five-and-twenty. hisir was gravend
stately,nd his manners were very formal. he had not been long seated

not doubt her seeingmll due time disposed marriage.

during dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoketll; but when servants
weredrawn, he thought time have some conversation his
guest,ndrefore started subject which he expected him
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate his patroness. lady
catherine de bourgh'sttention his wishes,nd consideration for
his comfort,ppeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen
better. mr. collins was eloquent her praise. subject elevated him
more than usual solemnity manner,nd most importantspect
he protested that “he had never his life witnessed such behaviour
person rank--suchffabilitynd condescension,s he had himself
experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased
approve both discourses which he hadlready had honour
preaching before her. she hadlsosked him twice dinet rosings,
had sent fhim only saturday before, make up her pool
quadrille evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seennything butffability her.
she hadlways spoken hims she wouldny other gentleman; she
made not smallest objection his joining society
neighbourhood nhis leaving parish occasionally fweek
two, vishis relations. she had even condescendeddvise him
marrys soons he could, provided he chose discretion;nd had
once paid him vishis humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approvedlllterations he had been making,nd had even vouchsafed
suggest some herself--some shelves closet up stairs.”

“that isll very propernd civil, im sure,” said mrs. bennet, “and
i dare say she is verygreeable woman. is pity that great ladies
generalre not more like her. does she live near you, sir?”

“garden which stands my humblebode is separated only by lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence.”

“i think you said she was widow, sir? has sheny family?”

“she has only one daughter, heiress rosings,nd very
extensive property.”

“ah!” said mrs. bennet, shaking her head, “then she is betterf than
many girls.nd what sort young lady is she? is she handsome?”

“she is most charming young ladydeed. lady catherine herself says
that, point true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superito
handsomest her sex, becausere is that her features which marks
young lady distinguished birth. she is unfortunately sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed,s im
informed by lady who superintended her education,nd who still
residesm. but she is perfectlymiable,ndten condescends
drive by my humblebode her little phaetonnd ponies.”

“has she been presented? i do not remember her namemong ladiest
court.”

“herdifferent state health unhappily prevents her beingwn;
by that means,s ild lady catherine one day, has deprived
british courts brightestnament. her ladyship seemed pleased
idea;nd you may imagine that im happy on every occasion
offer those little delicate compliments whichrelwayscceptable
ladies. i have more than once observed lady catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born be duchess,nd that most
elevated rank,stead giving her consequence, would bedorned by
her.sere kind little things which please her ladyship,nd
is sortttention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound

“you judge very properly,” said mr. bennet, “is happy fyou
that you possess talent flattering delicacy. may isk
whetherse pleasingttentions proceed from impulse
moment,re result previous study?”

“theyrise chiefly from what is passingt time,nd though i
sometimesmuse myself suggestingndrranging such little elegant
complimentss may bedapteddinary occasions, ilways wish
givems unstudiednirs possible.”

mr. bennet's expectations were fullynswered. his couswassbsurd
as he had hoped,nd he listened him keenest enjoyment,
maintainingt same time most resolute composure countenance,
and, exceptn occasional glancet elizabeth, requiring no partner
his pleasure.

by tea-time, however, dose had been enough,nd mr. bennet was glad
take his guestdrawing-roomgain,nd, when tewas over,
gladvite him readloud ladies. mr. collins readily
assented,nd book was produced; but, on beholding (feverything
announced be from circulating library), he started back,nd
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. kitty staredt
him,nd lydiexclaimed. other books were produced,ndfter some
deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons. lydigapeds he opened
volume,nd before he had, very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, sheterrupted him:

“do you know, mamma, that my uncle phillips talks turningway
richard;nd if he does, colonel forster will hire him. myuntld me
so herself on saturday. i shall walk meryton-morrow hear more
about,ndsk when mr. denny comes back fromwn.”

lydiwas bid by her two eldest sisters hold herngue; but mr.
collins, muchfended, laidside his book,nd said:

“i haveten observed how little young ladiesreterested by books
serious stamp, though written solely forir benefit.mazes
me, i confess; for, certainly,re can be nothing sodvantageous

then turning mr. bennet, hefered himselfs hisntagonistt
backgammon. mr. bennetccepted challenge, observing that hected
very wisely leaving girlsir own triflingmusements.
mrs. bennetnd her daughterspologised most civilly flydia's
interruption,nd promised that should not occurgain, if he would
resume his book; but mr. collins,fterssuringm that he bore his
young cousno ill-will,nd should never resent her behavioursny
affront, seated himselftnother table mr. bennet,nd prepared

mr. collins was not sensible man,nd deficiency nature had
been but littlessisted by education society; greatest part
his life having been spent under guidancen illiteratend
miserly father;nd though he belonged one universities, he
had merely kept necessary terms,out formingtny useful
acquaintance. subjection which his father had brought him up had
given himiginally great humility manner; but was now
good deal counteracted by self-conceweak head, living
retirement,nd consequential feelings earlynd unexpected
prosperity. fortunate chance had recommended him lady catherine de
bourgh when living hunsford was vacant;nd respect which
he felt fher high rank,nd his veneration fhers his patroness,

suitableness,nd excessively generousnd disinterested on his own

his plan did not vary on seeingm. miss bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views,nd establishedll his strictest notions what
was due seniority;nd ffirst evening _she_ was his settled
choice. next morning, however, madenlteration; fin
quartern hour's tete-a-tete mrs. bennet before breakfast,
conversation beginning his parsonage-house,nd leading naturally
tovowal his hopes, that mistress might be found fort
longbourn, produced from her,mid very complaisant smilesnd general
encouragement, cautiongainst very jane he had fixed on. “as
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her say--she could
not positivelynswer--but she did not _know_ny prepossession; her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she feltcumbent on her
hint, was likely be very soon engaged.”

mr. collins had only change from jane elizabeth--was soon
done--done while mrs. bennet was stirring fire. elizabeth, equally
next jane birthnd beauty, succeeded her course.

mrs. bennet treasured up hint,nd trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married;nd man whom she could not bear speak
day before was now high her good graces.

mr. dennynd mr. wickham walked young ladies doof

pressing entreaties thaty should come,nd even spite
mrs. phillips's throwing up parlour windownd loudly seconding

mrs. phillips waslways glad see her nieces;nd two eldest,
fromir recentbsence, were particularly welcome,nd she was
eagerly expressing her surprisetir sudden return home, which,s

however, might be justified by his relationship young ladies who

between two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either

such behaviour than her sister.

mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet bydmiring

that chimney-piecelone had cost eight hundred pounds, she feltll

mr. wickham was happy manwards whomlmost every female eye was

at leisure talk elizabeth,nd she was very willing hear
him, though what she chiefly wished hear she could not hope be
told--history hiscquaintance mr. darcy. she dared not
even mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. mr. wickham began subject himself. hequired how far
netherfield was from meryton;nd,fter receiving hernswer,sked
hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been stayingre.

“about month,” said elizabeth;ndn, unwilling let subject
drop,dded, “he is man very large property derbyshire, i
understand.”

“yes,” replied mr. wickham; “his estatere is noble one. clear
ten thouspernnum. you could not have met person more
capable giving you certainformation on that head than myself, for
i have been connected his family particular manner from my
infancy.”

elizabeth could not but look surprised.

“you may well be surprised, miss bennet,t suchnssertion,fter
seeing,s you probably might, very cold manner our meeting
yesterday.re you muchcquainted mr. darcy?”

“as muchs i ever wish be,” cried elizabeth very warmly. “i have
spent four days same house him,nd i think him very
disagreeable.”

“i have no right give _my_ opinion,” said wickham, “as his being
agreeable otherwise. im not qualified form one. i have known him
too longndo well be fair judge. is impossible f_me_
be impartial. but i believe your opinion him would general
astonish--perhaps you would not express quite so strongly
anywhere else. here youre your own family.”

“upon my word, i say no more _here_ than i might sayny house
neighbourhood, except netherfield. he is nottll liked
hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted his pride. you will not find
him more favourably spoken bynyone.”

“i cannot pretend be sorry,” said wickham,fter short
interruption, “that he thatny man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but _him_ i believe does notten happen.
world is blinded by his fortunend consequence, frightened by his
highnd imposing manners,nd sees him onlys he chooses be seen.”

“i should take him, even on _my_ slightcquaintance, ben
ill-tempered man.” wickham only shook his head.

“i wonder,” said he,t next opportunity speaking, “whether he is
likely be country much longer.”

“i do nottll know; but i _heard_ nothing his goingway when i
wast netherfield. i hope your plans favour ----shire will
not beffected by his being neighbourhood.”

“oh! no--is not f_me_ be drivenway by mr. darcy. if _he_
wishesvoid seeing _me_, he must go. were not on friendly terms,
andlways gives me pameet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim beforell world, sense
very great ill-usage,nd most painful regretst his being what he
is. his father, miss bennet, late mr. darcy, was one best men
that ever breathed,nd truest friend i ever had;nd i can never
be company mr. darcyout being grieved soul by
thoustender recollections. his behaviour myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive himnythingnd
everything, rather than his disappointing hopesnd disgracing
memory his father.”

elizabeth foundterest subjectcrease,nd listened
all her heart; but delicacy prevented furtherquiry.

mr. wickham began speak on more generalpics, meryton,
neighbourhood, society,ppearing highly pleasedll that
he had yet seen,nd speaking latter gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.

“was prospect constant society,nd good society,” hedded,
“which was my chiefducement enter ----shire. i knew be
most respectable,greeable corps,nd my friend denny tempted me
further by hisccountir present quarters,nd very great
attentionsnd excellentcquaintances meryton had procuredm.
society, i own, is necessary me. i have been disappointed man,nd
my spirits will not bear solitude. i _must_ have employmentnd society.
military life is not what i wastended for, but circumstances have
now made eligible. church _ought_ have been my profession--i
was brought up fchurch,nd i shouldt time have been
possession most valuable living, had pleased gentleman we
were speaking just now.”

“indeed!”

“yes--late mr. darcy bequeathed me next presentation best
living his gift. he was my godfather,nd excessivelyttached me.
i cannot do justice his kindness. he meant provide fmemply,
thought he had done; but when living fell, was given
elsewhere.”

“good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? how could his
will be disregarded? why did you not seek legal redress?”

“there was just suchnformality terms bequests
give me no hope from law. man honour could not have doubted
intention, but mr. darcy chose doubt--treats merely
conditional recommendation,ndssert that i had forfeitedll claim
by extravagance, imprudence--shortnything nothing. certain
is, that living became vacant two yearsgo, exactlys i was
ofnge hold,nd that was givennother man;nd no
less certais, that i cannotccuse myself having really done
anything deserve lose. i have warm, unguarded temper,nd
i may have spoken my opinion _of_ him,nd _to_ him,o freely. i can
recall nothing worse. but fact is, that were very different sort
men,nd that he hates me.”

“is quite shocking! he deserves be publicly disgraced.”

“some time other he _will_ be--but shall not be by _me_. till i
can forget his father, i can never defy expose _him_.”

elizabeth honoured him fsuch feelings,nd thought him handsomer than
evers he expressedm.

“but what,” said she,fter pause, “can have been his motive? what can
haveduced him behave so cruelly?”

“thorough, determined dislike me--dislike which i cannot but
attribute some measure jealousy. had late mr. darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment me irritated him, i believe, very early life. he had
not temper bear sort competition which we stood--sort
preference which wasten given me.”

“i had not thought mr. darcy so bads--though i have never liked
him. i had not thought so very ill him. i had supposed him be
despising his fellow-creatures general, but did not suspect him
descending such malicious revenge, suchjustice, suchhumanitys
this.”

after few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “i _do_
remember his boasting one day,t netherfield, implacability
his resentments, his havingn unforgiving temper. his disposition
must be dreadful.”

“i will not trust myself on subject,” replied wickham; “i can hardly
be just him.”

elizabeth wasgadeep thought,ndfter time exclaimed, “to
treat such manner godson, friend, favourite his
father!” she could havedded, “young man,o, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch fyour beingmiable”--but she contented herself
with, “one,o, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connectedgether,s i think you said, closest manner!”

“we were born same parish,same park; greatest
part our youth was passedgether;mates same house,
sharing samemusements, objects same parental care. _my_
father began life profession which your uncle, mr. phillips,
appears do so much credto--but he gave up everything be
use late mr. darcynd devotedll his time care
pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, most
intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcytencknowledged himself
be under greatest obligations my father'sctive superintendence,
when, immediately before my father's death, mr. darcy gave him
voluntary promise providing fme, im convinced that he felt
bes much debt gratitude _him_,s hisffection myself.”

“how strange!” cried elizabeth. “howbominable! i wonder that very
pride mr. darcy has not made him just you! if from no better
motive, that he should not have beeno proud be dishonest--for
dishonesty i must call.”

“_is_ wonderful,” replied wickham, “forlmostll hisctions may
be traced pride;nd pride hadten been his best friend. has
connected him nearer virtue thanny other feeling. but were
none us consistent,nd his behaviour mere were stronger
impulses even than pride.”

“can suchbominable prides his have ever done him good?”

“yes. hasten led him be liberalnd generous, give his money
freely, display hospitality,ssist his tenants,nd relieve
poor. family pride,nd _filial_ pride--fhe is very proud what
his father was--have done. notppear disgrace his family,
degenerate from popular qualities, losefluence
pemberley house, is powerful motive. he haslso _brotherly_ pride,
which, _some_ brotherlyffection, makes him very kindnd
careful guardian his sister,nd you will hear him generally cried up
as mostttentivend best brothers.”

“what sort girl is miss darcy?”

he shook his head. “i wish i could call hermiable. gives me pain
speak ill darcy. but she iso much like her brother--very, very
proud.s child, she wasffectionatend pleasing,nd extremely fond
me;nd i have devoted hoursnd hours hermusement. but she is
nothing me now. she is handsome girl,bout fifteen sixteen,
and, i understand, highlyccomplished. since her father's death, her
home has been london, where lady lives her,nd superintends her
education.”

after many pausesnd many trials other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more first,nd saying:

“imstonishedt histimacy mr. bingley! how can mr. bingley,
who seems good humourself,nd is, i really believe, trulymiable,
be friendship such man? how cany sueach other? do you
know mr. bingley?”

“nottll.”

“he is sweet-tempered,miable, charming man. he cannot know what mr.
darcy is.”

“probably not; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does not
wantbilities. he can be conversible companion if he thinks worth
his while.mong those whoretll his equals consequence, he is
very different man from what he is less prosperous. his
pride never deserts him; but rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable,nd perhapsgreeable--allowing something
ffortunend figure.”

whist party soonfterwards breaking up, players gathered round
other tablend mr. collinsok his station between his cousin
elizabethnd mrs. phillips. usualquiriess his success were
made by latter. had not been very great; he had lost every
point; but when mrs. phillips began express her concernreupon,
hessured her much earnest gravity that was not least
importance, that he considered moneys mere trifle,nd begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.

“i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sdown
card-table,y must takeir chancesse things,nd happily i
am not such circumstancess make five shillingsny object.re
are undoubtedly many who could not say same, but thanks lady
catherine de bourgh, im removed far beyond necessity regarding
little matters.”

mr. wickham'sttention was caught;ndfter observing mr. collins for
few moments, hesked elizabeth low voice whether her relation
was verytimatelycquainted family de bourgh.

“lady catherine de bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him
living. i hardly know how mr. collins was firsttroduced her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”

“you know course that lady catherine de bourghnd ladynne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she isunt present mr. darcy.”

“no,deed, i did not. i knew nothingtll lady catherine's
connections. i never heard her existence till day before
yesterday.”

“her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have very large fortune,nd is
believed that shend her couswill unite two estates.”

information made elizabeth smile,s she thought pomiss
bingley. vaindeed must bell herttentions, vainnd useless her
affection fhis sisternd her praise himself, if he werelready
self-destined fornother.

“mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly both lady catherinend her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related her ladyship,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him,nd that spite her being his
patroness, she isnrrogant, conceited woman.”

“i believe her be both great degree,” replied wickham; “i have
not seen her fmany years, but i very well remember that i never liked
her,nd that her manners were dictatorialndsolent. she has
reputation being remarkably sensiblend clever; but i rather believe
she derives part herbilities from her ranknd fortune, part from
heruthoritative manner,nd rest from pride fher
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected him should haven
understanding first class.”

elizabethllowed that he had given very rationalccount,nd
they continued talkinggether, mutual satisfaction till supper
putn end cards,nd gave rest ladiesir share mr.
wickham'sttentions.re could be no conversation noise
mrs. phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him
everybody. whatever he said, was said well;nd whatever he did, done
gracefully. elizabeth wentway her head full him. she could
think nothing but mr. wickham,nd what he hadld her,ll
way home; butre was not time fher even mention his name
asy went, fneither lydinmr. collins were once silent. lydia
talkedcessantly lottery tickets, fish she had lostnd
fish she had won;nd mr. collins describing civility mr.nd
mrs. phillips, protesting that he did not least regard his losses
at whist, enumeratingll dishest supper,nd repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more say than he could well manage
before carriage stoppedt longbourn house.

elizabeth related jane next day what had passed between mr.
wickhamnd herself. jane listenedstonishmentnd concern; she
knew not how believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy mr.
bingley's regard;nd yet, was not her nature question
veracity young man suchmiableppearances wickham.
possibility his having endured such unkindness, was enough
interestll her tender feelings;nd nothing remainedrefore be
done, but think wellm both, defend conduct each,
throwtoccountccident mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

“they have both,” said she, “been deceived, i dare say, some way
other, which we can form no idea.terested people have perhaps
misrepresented each other. is, short, impossible fus
conjecture causes circumstances which may havelienatedm,
withoutctual blame on either side.”

“very true,deed;nd now, my dear jane, what have you got say on
behalfterested people who have probably been concerned
business? do clear _them_o, we shall be obliged think ill
somebody.”

“laughs muchs you choose, but you will not laugh me out my
opinion. my dearest lizzy, do but consider what disgraceful light
places mr. darcy, be treating his father's favourite such
manner, one whom his father had promised provide for. is
impossible. no man common humanity, no man who hadny value fhis
character, could be capable. can his mosttimate friends be so
excessively deceived him? oh! no.”

“i can much more easily believe mr. bingley's being imposed on, than
that mr. wickham shouldvent such history himselfs he gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentionedout ceremony. if
be not so, let mr. darcy contradict. besides,re was truth his
looks.”

“is difficultdeed--is distressing. one does not know what
think.”

“i beg your pardon; one knows exactly what think.”

but jane could think certainty on only one point--that mr. bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much suffer whenffair
became public.

two young ladies were summoned from shrubbery, where
conversation passed, byrrival very persons whomy had
been speaking; mr. bingleynd his sisters came giveir personal
invitation flong-expected ballt netherfield, which was fixed
ffollowing tuesday. two ladies were delighted seeir

asked what she had been doing herself sinceir separation.

as muchs possible, saying not much elizabeth,nd nothingtll

prospect netherfield ball was extremelygreeable every
female family. mrs. bennet chose considers given
compliment her eldest daughter,nd was particularly flattered
by receivingvitation from mr. bingley himself,stead
ceremonious card. jane pictured herself happy evening

elizabeth thought pleasure dancing great deal mr.
wickham,nd seeing confirmation everything mr. darcy's look

less onny single event,ny particular person, fthoughy
each, like elizabeth, meant dance half evening mr. wickham,
he was by no means only partner who could satisfym,nd ball
was,tny rate, ball.nd even mary couldssure her family that she
had no disinclination for.

“while i can have my mornings myself,” said she, “is enough--i
think is no sacrifice jooccasionally evening engagements.
society has claims on usll;nd i profess myself one those
who considertervals recreationndmusements desirable for
everybody.”

elizabeth's spirits were so high on occasion, that though she did
notten speak unnecessarily mr. collins, she could not helpsking
him whether hetendedccept mr. bingley'svitation,nd if
he did, whether he would think proper joevening's
amusement;nd she was rather surprised find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head,nd was very far from dreading rebuke
either fromrchbishop, lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing
dance.

“im by no means opinion, issure you,” said he, “that ball
kind, given by young man character, respectable people,
can haveny evil tendency;nd im so far from objecting dancing
myself, that i shall hope be honoured handsll my fair
cousins course evening;nd i take opportunity
soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, ftwo first dances especially,
preference which i trust my cousjane willttribute right
cause,nd notny disrespect fher.”

elizabeth felt herself completely taken. she had fully proposed being
engaged by mr. wickham fthose very dances;nd have mr. collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed.re was no help
for, however. mr. wickham's happinessnd her own were perforce
delayed little longer,nd mr. collins's proposalccepteds
good graces she could. she was not better pleased his
gallantry from idesuggested something more. now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected frommong her sisterss worthy

chapter 18


till elizabeth entered drawing-roomt netherfield,nd looked
vafmr. wickhammong cluster red coatsressembled,
doubt his being present had never occurred her. certainty
meeting him had not been checked byny those recollections that
might not unreasonably havelarmed her. she had dressed more than
usual care,nd prepared highest spirits fconquestll
that remained unsubdued his heart, trusting that was not more than
might be won course evening. butnstantrose
dreadful suspicion his being purposely omitted fmr. darcy's

was not exactly case,bsolute fact hisbsence was
pronounced by his friend denny, whom lydieagerlypplied,nd who
toldm that wickham had been obliged gown on business
day before,nd was not yet returned;dding, significant smile,
“i do not imagine his business would have called himway just now, if
he had not wantedvoid certagentleman here.”

part histelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth,nd,sssured her that darcy was not lessnswerable for
wickham'sbsence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling displeasuregainst former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly replylerable civility
politequiries which he directlyfterwardspproached make.
attendance, forbearance, patience darcy, wasjury wickham. she
was resolvedgainstny sort conversation him,nd turnedway
degree ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even
speaking mr. bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

but elizabeth was not formed fill-humour;nd though every prospect
her own was destroyed fevening, could not dwell long on her
spirits;nd havingldll her griefs charlotte lucas, whom she had
not seen fweek, she was soonble make voluntary transition
oddities her cousin,nd point him out her particular
notice. first two dances, however, brought return distress;
they were dances mortification. mr. collins,wkwardnd solemn,
apologisingsteadttending,ndten moving wrongout being
aware, gave herll shamend misery which disagreeable
partner fcouple dances can give. moment her release from
him was ecstasy.

she danced nextnficer,nd had refreshment talking
wickham,nd hearing that he was universally liked. when those dances
were over, she returned charlotte lucas,nd was conversation
her, when she found herself suddenlyddressed by mr. darcy whook
her so much by surprise hispplication fher hand, that,
without knowing what she did, sheccepted him. he walkedwaygain
immediately,nd she was left fret over her own want presence
mind; charlotte tried console her:

“i dare say you will find him verygreeable.”

“heaven forbid! _that_ would be greatest misfortunell! find
mangreeable whom one is determined hate! do not wish me suchn
evil.”

when dancing recommenced, however,nd darcypproached claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her whisper, not be
simpleton,ndllow her fancy fwickham make herppear unpleasant
eyes man ten times his consequence. elizabeth made no
answer,ndok her place set,mazedt dignity which
she wasrrived beingllowed stopposite mr. darcy,nd
reading her neighbours' looks,ir equalmazement beholding
it.y stood fsome timeout speaking word;nd she began
imagine thatir silence was last through two dances,ndt
first was resolved not break; till suddenly fancying that would
be greater punishment her partner oblige him talk, she made
some slight observation on dance. he replied,nd wasgain
silent.fter pause some minutes, sheddressed him second time
with:--“is _your_ turn say something now, mr. darcy. i talked
about dance,nd _you_ ought make some sort remark on size
room, number couples.”

he smiled,ndssured her that whatever she wished him say should be
said.

“very well. that reply will do fpresent. perhaps bynd by i may
observe that private ballsre much pleasanter than public ones. but
_now_ we may be silent.”

“do you talk by rule,n, while youre dancing?”

“sometimes. one must speak little, you know. would look odd be
entirely silent fhalfn hourgether;nd yet fordvantage
_some_, conversation ought be sorranged,s thaty may have
trouble sayings littles possible.”

“are you consulting your own feelings present case, do you
imagine that youre gratifying mine?”

“both,” replied elizabethrchly; “fi havelways seen great
similarity turn our minds. were eachn unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling speak, unless we expect say
something that willmaze whole room,nd be handed down
posterityll eclat proverb.”

“is no very striking resemblance your own character, im sure,”
 said he. “how near may be _mine_, i cannot pretend say. _you_
think faithful portraundoubtedly.”

“i must not decide on my own performance.”

he made nonswer,ndy weregasilent tilly had gone down
dance, when hesked her if shend her sisters did not veryten
walk meryton. shensweredffirmative,nd, unable resist
temptation,dded, “when you met usre other day, we had just
been forming newcquaintance.”

effect was immediate. deeper shade _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not word,nd elizabeth, though blaming herself
fher own weakness, could not go on.t length darcy spoke,nd
constrained manner said, “mr. wickham is blessed such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable
_retaining_m, is less certain.”

“he has been so unluckys lose _your_ friendship,” replied elizabeth
emphasis, “manner which he is likely suffer fromll
his life.”

darcy made nonswer,nd seemed desirous changing subject.t
that moment, sir william lucasppeared closem, meaning pass
through set other side room; but on perceiving mr.
darcy, he stopped bow supericourtesy compliment him on
his dancingnd his partner.

“i have been most highly gratifieddeed, my dear sir. such very
superidancing is notten seen. is evident that you belong
first circles.llow me say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you,nd that i must hope have pleasureten repeated,
especially when certadesirable event, my dear eliz(glancingt
her sisternd bingley) shall take place. what congratulations willn
flow! ippeal mr. darcy:--but let me notterrupt you, sir. you
will not thank me fdetaining you from bewitching converse that
young lady, whose bright eyesrelso upbraiding me.”

latter partddress was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william'sllusion his friend seemed strike him forcibly,nd his
eyes were directed very serious expressionwards bingleynd
jane, who were dancinggether. recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned his partner,nd said, “sir william'sterruption has made
me forget what we were talking.”

“i do not think we were speakingtll. sir william could not have
interrupted two people room who had less say formselves.
we have tried two three subjectslreadyout success,nd what we
are talk next i cannot imagine.”

“what think you books?” said he, smiling.

“books--oh! no. im sure we never read same, not same
feelings.”

“im sorry you think so; but if that be case,re cant least be
no want subject. we may compare our different opinions.”

“no--i cannot talk books ball-room; my head islways full
something else.”

“_present_lways occupies you such scenes--does?” said he,
look doubt.

“yes,lways,” she replied,out knowing what she said, fher
thoughts had wandered far from subject,s soonfterwardsppeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. youre very cautious, i suppose,ss _being
created_.”

“im,” said he, firm voice.

“neverllow yourself be blinded by prejudice?”

“i hope not.”

“is particularlycumbent on those who never changeir opinion,
be secure judging properlyt first.”

“may isk whatse questions tend?”

“merely illustration _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
shakef her gravity. “im trying make out.”

“what is your success?”

she shook her head. “i do not get ontll. i hear such different
accounts yous puzzle me exceedingly.”

“i can readily believe,”nswered he gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly respect me;nd i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not sketch my charactert present moment,sre is reason
fear that performance would reflect no credon either.”

“but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never havenother
opportunity.”

“i would by no means suspendny pleasure yours,” he coldly replied.
she said no more,ndy went down other dancend parted
silence;nd on each side dissatisfied, though notn equal degree,
fdarcy's breastre waslerably powerful feelingwards
her, which soon procured her pardon,nd directedll hisngergainst
another.

they had not long separated, when miss bingley camewards her,nd
withn expression civil disdainccosted her:

“so, miss eliza, i hear youre quite delighted george wickham!
your sister has been talking mebout him,ndsking me thousand
questions;nd i find that young man quite forgot tell you,mong
his other communication, that he was son old wickham, late
mr. darcy's steward. let me recommend you, however,s friend, not
give implicconfidencell hisssertions; fors mr. darcy's
using him ill, is perfectly false; for, on contrary, he has
always been remarkably kind him, though george wickham has treated
mr. darcy mostfamous manner. i do not know particulars, but
i know very well that mr. darcy is not least blame, that he
cannot bear hear george wickham mentioned,nd that though my brother
thought that he could not wellvoidcluding him hisvitation
officers, he was excessively glad find that he had taken himself
out way. his comingcountrytll is mostsolent
thing,deed,nd i wonder how he could presume do. i pity you,
miss eliza, fdiscovery your favourite's guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”

“his guiltnd his descentppear by yourccount be same,” said
elizabethngrily; “fi have heard youccuse him nothing worse
than being son mr. darcy's steward,nd _that_, i can
assure you, heformed me himself.”

“i beg your pardon,” replied miss bingley, turningway sneer.
“excuse myterference--was kindly meant.”

“insolent girl!” said elizabeth herself. “youre much mistaken
if you expectfluence me by such paltryttacks. i see
nothing but your own wilful ignorancend malice mr.
darcy.” shen sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken make
inquiries on same subject bingley. jane met her smile
such sweet complacency, glow such happy expression,s sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied occurrences evening.
elizabethstantly read her feelings,ndt that moment solicitude for
wickham, resentmentgainst his enemies,nd everything else, gave way
before hope jane's being fairest way fhappiness.

“i want know,” said she, countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, “what you have learntbout mr. wickham. but perhaps you have
beeno pleasantly engaged thinkny third person; which case
you may be sure my pardon.”

“no,” replied jane, “i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory tell you. mr. bingley does not know whole
his history,nd is quite ignorant circumstances which have
principallyfended mr. darcy; but he will vouch fgood conduct,
probity,nd honour his friend,nd is perfectly convinced that
mr. wickham has deserved much lessttention from mr. darcy than he has
received;nd im sorry say by hisccounts wells his sister's,
mr. wickham is by no means respectable young man. imfraid he has
been very imprudent,nd has deserved lose mr. darcy's regard.”

“mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself?”

“no; he never saw him till other morningt meryton.”

“thisccountn is what he has received from mr. darcy. im
satisfied. but what does he say living?”

“he does not exactly recollect circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that was left
him _conditionally_ only.”

“i have not doubt mr. bingley's sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly;
“but you must excuse my not being convinced byssurances only. mr.
bingley's defense his friend was veryble one, i dare say; but
since he is unacquainted several parts story,nd has learnt
rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still think
both gentlemens i did before.”

shen changed discourse one more gratifying each,nd on
whichre could be no difference sentiment. elizabeth listened
delight happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained mr.
bingley's regard,nd saidll her power heighten her confidence
in. onir being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabethdrew
miss lucas; whosequiryfter pleasantness her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came upm,
told her great exultation that he had just been so fortunates
make most important discovery.

“i have found out,” said he, “by singularccident, thatre is now
room near relation my patroness. i happened overhear
gentleman himself mentioning young lady who does honours
house names his cousmiss de bourgh,nd her mother lady
catherine. how wonderfullyse sort things occur! who would have
thought my meeting, perhaps, nephew lady catherine de
bourghssembly! im most thankful that discovery is made
time fme pay my respects him, which im now going
do,nd trust he will excuse my not having done before. mytal
ignorance connection must plead mypology.”

“youre not goingtroduce yourself mr. darcy!”

“indeed im. i shall entreat his pardon fnot having done earlier.
i believe him be lady catherine's _nephew_. will be my power
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.”

elizabeth tried hard dissuade him from such scheme,ssuring him
that mr. darcy would consider hisddressing himouttroduction
asn impertinent freedom, rather than compliment hisunt; that
was not least necessaryre should beny notice on either
side;nd that if were, must belong mr. darcy, superiin
consequence, begincquaintance. mr. collins listened her
determinedir following his ownclination,nd, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus:

“my dear miss elizabeth, i have highest opinion world

profby yourdvice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though case before us i consider myself more fitted by
educationnd habitual study decide on what is right than young
lady like yourself.”nd low bow he left herttack mr.
darcy, whose reception hisdvances she eagerly watched,nd whose
astonishmentt being soddressed was very evident. her cousprefaced
his speech solemn bownd though she could not hear word
it, she felts if hearingll,nd saw motion his lips
words “apology,” “hunsford,”nd “lady catherine de bourgh.” vexed
her see him expose himself such man. mr. darcy was eyeing him
unrestrained wonder,nd whent last mr. collinsllowed him time
speak, repliednir distant civility. mr. collins, however,
was not discouraged from speakinggain,nd mr. darcy's contempt seemed
abundantlycreasing length his second speech,ndt
end he only made him slight bow,nd movednother way. mr.
collinsn returned elizabeth.

“i have no reason, issure you,” said he, “be dissatisfied my
reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleasedttention. henswered
me utmost civility,nd even paid me compliment saying
that he was so well convinced lady catherine's discernments be
certashe could never bestow favour unworthily. was really very
handsome thought. upon whole, im much pleased him.”

as elizabeth had no longernyterest her own pursue, she turned
herttentionlmost entirely on her sisternd mr. bingley;nd
traingreeable reflections which her observations gave birth,
made her perhapslmosts happys jane. she saw her idesettled
that very house,ll felicity which marriage trueffection
could bestow;nd she felt capable, under such circumstances,
endeavouring even like bingley's two sisters. her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent same way,nd she determined not
venture near her, lest she might hearo much. wheny sat down
supper,refore, she considered most unlucky perverseness which
placedmone each other;nd deeply was she vexed find
that her mother was talking that one person (lady lucas) freely,
openly,nd nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon
be married mr. bingley. wasnnimating subject,nd mrs. bennet
seemedcapable fatigue while enumeratingdvantages
match. his being such charming young man,nd so rich,nd living but
three miles fromm, were first points self-gratulation;nd
then was such comfort think how fond two sisters were
jane,nd be certathaty must desire connections muchs
she could do. was, moreover, such promising thing fher younger
daughters,s jane's marrying so greatly must throwm way
other rich men;nd lastly, was so pleasantt her time life be
able consign her single daughters careir sister, that
she might not be obliged gocompany more than she liked. was
necessary make circumstance matter pleasure, because on
such occasions is etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs.
bennet find comfort staying hometny period her life. she
concluded many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidentlynd triumphantly believingre was no
chance.

vadid elizabeth endeavour check rapidity her mother's
words, persuade her describe her felicity lessudible
whisper; for, herexpressible vexation, she could perceive that
chief was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat oppositem. her
mother only scolded her fbeing nonsensical.

“what is mr. darcy me, pray, that i should befraid him? im
sure we owe him no such particular civilitys be obliged say
nothing _he_ may not like hear.”

“fheaven's sake, madam, speak lower. whatdvantage can be fyou
offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself his friend by
so doing!”

nothing that she could say, however, hadnyfluence. her mother would
talk her views sametelligiblene. elizabeth blushednd
blushedgashamend vexation. she could not help frequently
glancing her eyet mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her what
she dreaded; fthough he was notlways lookingt her mother, she was
convinced that histtention wasvariably fixed by her. expression
his face changed gradually fromdignant contempt composednd
steady gravity.

at length, however, mrs. bennet had no more say;nd lady lucas, who
had been long yawningt repetition delights which she saw no
likelihood sharing, was left comforts cold hamnd
chicken. elizabeth now began revive. but not long wasterval
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked,nd
she had mortification seeing mary,fter very little entreaty,
preparing oblige company. by many significant looksnd silent
entreaties, did she endeavour prevent such procomplaisance,
but vain; mary would not understthem; suchn opportunity
exhibiting was delightful her,nd she began her song. elizabeth's
eyes were fixed on her most painful sensations,nd she watched her
progress through several stanzasn impatience which was very
ill rewardedtir close; fmary, on receiving,mongst thanks
table, hint hope that she might be prevailed on
favourmgain,fter pause half minute begannother.
mary's powers were by no means fitted fsuch display; her voice was
weak,nd her mannerffected. elizabeth wasgonies. she lookedt
jane, see how she bore; but jane was very composedly talking
bingley. she lookedt his two sisters,nd sawm making signs
derisiont each other,ndt darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. she lookedt her father entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singingll night. heok hint,
when mary had finished her second song, saidloud, “that will do
extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough. let other
young ladies have time exhibit.”

mary, though pretending not hear, was somewhat disconcerted;nd
elizabeth, sorry fher,nd sorry fher father's speech, wasfraid
hernxiety had done no good. others party were nowpplied.

“if i,” said mr. collins, “were so fortunates beble sing, i
should have great pleasure, im sure, obliging companyn

compatible profession clergyman. i do not mean, however,
tossert that we can be justified devotingo much our time

suchngreement ftithess may be beneficial himselfnd not
offensive his patron. he must write his own sermons;nd time
that remains will not beo much fhis parish duties,nd care

as comfortables possible.nd i do not think light importance
that he should havettentivend conciliatory mannerswards everybody,
especiallywards those whom he owes his preferment. i cannotcquit
him that duty; ncould i think well man who should omitn
occasion testifying his respectwardsnybody connected
family.”nd bow mr. darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so louds be heard by half room. many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked moremused than mr. bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended mr. collins fhaving spoken so sensibly,
observed half-whisper lady lucas, that he was remarkably
clever, good kind young man.

elizabethppeared that, had her family madengreement
exposemselvess muchsy could during evening, would
have been impossible form playir parts more spiror
finer success;nd happy did she think fbingleynd her sister
that some exhibition had escaped his notice,nd that his
feelings were not sort be much distressed by folly which he
must have witnessed. that his two sistersnd mr. darcy, however, should
have suchn opportunity ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
she could not determine whether silent contempt
gentleman,solent smiles ladies, were moretolerable.

rest evening brought her littlemusement. she was teased by
mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side,nd though
he could not prevail on her dance himgain, put out her
power dance others. vadid she entreat him stup
somebody else,ndfertroduce himny young lady room.
hessured her, thats dancing, he was perfectlydifferent;
that his chief object was by delicatettentions recommend himself
hernd that he shouldrefore make point remaining close her
whole evening.re was norguing upon such project. she owed
her greatest relief her friend miss lucas, whoten joinedm,nd
good-naturedly engaged mr. collins's conversation herself.

she wast least free fromfense mr. darcy's further notice;
thoughten standingvery short distance her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough speak. she felt be
probable consequence herllusions mr. wickham,nd rejoiced
it.

longbourn party were lastll company depart,nd, by
manoeuvre mrs. bennet, had waforir carriage quarter
an hourfter everybody else was gone, which gavem time see how
heartilyy were wishedway by some family. mrs. hurstnd her
sister scarcely openedir mouths, except complafatigue,nd
were evidently impatient have housemselves.y repulsed
everyttempt mrs. bennett conversation,nd by so doing threw
languover whole party, which was very little relieved by
long speeches mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingleynd his
sisters on eleganceir entertainment,nd hospitalitynd
politeness which had markedir behaviourir guests. darcy said
nothingtll. mr. bennet, equal silence, was enjoying scene.
mr. bingleynd jane were standinggether, little detached from
rest,nd talked only each other. elizabeth preserveds steady
silences either mrs. hurst miss bingley;nd even lydiwaso
much fatigued utter more than occasional exclamation “lord,
how tired im!”ccompanied by violent yawn.

whent lengthyrose take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
civil her hope seeing whole family soont longbourn,nd
addressed herself especially mr. bingley,ssure him how happy he
would makem by eating family dinnermtny time,out
ceremony formalvitation. bingley wasll grateful pleasure,
he readily engaged ftaking earliest opportunity waiting on
her,fter his return from london, whither he was obliged go next
day fshort time.

mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied,nd quitted house under
delightful persuasion that,llowing fnecessary preparations
settlements, new carriages,nd wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settledt netherfield course three four
months. havingnother daughter married mr. collins, she thought
equal certainty,nd considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
elizabeth was least dear herll her children;nd though
mannd match were quite good enough f_her_, worth each
was eclipsed by mr. bingleynd netherfield.



chapter 19


next day opened new scenet longbourn. mr. collins made his
declaration form. having resolved doout loss time,s
his leavebsence extended only following saturday,nd having
no feelings diffidence make distressing himself event
moment, he setbout veryderly manner,ll
observances, which he supposed regular part business. on
finding mrs. bennet, elizabeth,nd one younger girlsgether,
soonfter breakfast, heddressed motherse words:

“may i hope, madam, fyourterest your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicfhonour privateudience her
course morning?”

before elizabeth had time fornything but blush surprise, mrs.
bennetnsweredstantly, “oh dear!--yes--certainly. im sure lizzy
will be very happy--im sure she can have no objection. come, kitty, i
want you up stairs.”nd, gathering her workgether, she was hastening
away, when elizabeth called out:

“dear madam, do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuse
me. he can have nothing say me thatnybody need not hear. im
goingway myself.”

“no, no, nonsense, lizzy. i desire you stay where youre.”nd upon
elizabeth's seeming really, vexednd embarrassed looks,bout
escape, shedded: “lizzy, i _insist_ upon your stayingnd hearing mr.
collins.”

elizabeth would not oppose suchnjunction--moment's
consideration making herlso sensible that would be wisest get
overs soonnds quietlys possible, she sat downgainnd tried
conceal, bycessant employment feelings which were divided between
distressnd diversion. mrs. bennetnd kitty walkedf,nds soons
they were gone, mr. collins began.

“believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing youny disservice, ratherdds your other perfections. you
would have been lessmiable my eyes hadre _not_ been little
unwillingness; butllow messure you, that i have your respected
mother's permission forddress. you can hardly doubt
purport my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you
dissemble; myttentions have beeno marked be mistaken.lmosts
soons i entered house, i singled you outs companion
my future life. but before im runway by my feelings on
subject, perhaps would bedvisable fme state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, fcominghertfordshire design
selecting wife,s i certainly did.”

idemr. collins,ll his solemn composure, being runway
by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use short pause hellowednyttempt stop him further,
he continued:

“my reasons fmarryingre, first, that i think right thing for
every clergyman easy circumstances (like myself) set example
matrimony his parish; secondly, that im convinced that will
add very greatly my happiness;nd thirdly--which perhaps i ought
have mentioned earlier, that is particulardvicend
recommendation very noble lady whom i have honour calling
patroness. twice has she condescended give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on subject;nd was but very saturday night before i
left hunsford--between our poolst quadrille, while mrs. jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'mr. collins, you
must marry. clergyman like you must marry. choose properly, choose
gentlewoman f_my_ sake;nd fyour _own_, let her benctive,
useful sort person, not brought up high, butble make small
income go good way. is mydvice. find such womans soons
you can, bring her hunsford,nd i will visher.'llow me, by
way, observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon notice

anything i can describe;nd your witnd vivacity, i think, must be
acceptable her, especially when tempered silencend
respect which her rank willevitably excite. thus much fmy general
intention favour matrimony; remains beld why my views
were directedwards longbournstead my own neighbourhood, where i
canssure yourere manymiable young women. but fact is, that
being,s im,herestatefter death your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), i could not satisfy
myselfout resolving choose wife frommong his daughters, that
lossm might bes littles possible, when melancholy
event takes place--which, however,s i havelready said, may not
be fseveral years. has been my motive, my fair cousin,nd
i flatter myself will not sink me your esteem.nd now nothing
remains fme butssure you mostnimated language

shall make no demthat nature on your father, since im well
aware that could not be complied;nd that one thouspounds
four per cents, which will not be yours tillfter your mother's
decease, isll that you may ever be entitled. on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent;nd you mayssure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when were married.”

wasbsolutely necessaryterrupt him now.

“youreo hasty, sir,” she cried. “you forget that i have made no
answer. let me doout further loss time.ccept my thanks for
compliment youre paying me. im very sensible honour
your proposals, but is impossible fme do otherwise than

“im not now learn,” replied mr. collins, formal wave

favour;nd that sometimes refusal is repeated second, even
third time. imrefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said,nd shall hope lead youltar ere long.”

“upon my word, sir,” cried elizabeth, “your hope is rather
extraordinary onefter my declaration. i dossure you that im not

could make you so. nay, were your friend lady catherine know me, i
am persuaded she would find me every respect ill qualified for

“were certathat lady catherine would think so,” said mr. collins
very gravely--“but i cannot imagine that her ladyship wouldtll
disapprove you.nd you may be certawhen i have honour
seeing hergain, i shall speak very highest terms your
modesty, economy,nd othermiable qualification.”

“indeed, mr. collins,ll praise me will be unnecessary. you
must give me leave judge fmyself,nd pay me compliment

thus spoke, she would have quitted room, had mr. collins not thus
addressed her:

“when i do myself honour speaking you next on subject, i
shall hope receive more favourablenswer than you have now given
me; though im far fromccusing you crueltyt present, because i
know be established custom your sex reject man on

“really, mr. collins,” cried elizabeth some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly. if what i have hithersaid canppear you form
encouragement, i know not how express my refusal such ways
convince yous being one.”

“you must give me leave flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your

“i dossure you, sir, that i have no pretensions whatever that kind

“youre uniformly charming!” cried he,nirwkward

chapter 20


mr. collins was not left long silent contemplation his
successful love; fmrs. bennet, having dawdledbout vestibule
watch fend conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open
doornd quick step pass herwards staircase, than she
entered breakfast-room,nd congratulated both himnd herself
warm terms on happy prospectir nearer connection. mr. collins
receivednd returnedse felicitations equal pleasure,ndn
proceeded relate particularsirterview, result
which he trusted he had every reason be satisfied, since
refusal which his coushad steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modestynd genuine delicacy her character.

information, however, startled mrs. bennet; she would have been
glad be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant encourage
him by protestinggainst his proposals, but she dared not believe,
could not help saying so.

“but, depend upon, mr. collins,” shedded, “that lizzy shall be
brought reason. i will speak herbout directly. she is very
headstrong, foolish girl,nd does not know her ownterest but i will
_make_ her know.”

“pardon me finterrupting you, madam,” cried mr. collins; “but if
she is really headstrongnd foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be very desirable wife man my situation, who
naturally looks fhappiness marriage state. ifrefore she
actually persists rejecting my suit, perhaps were better not
force hertoccepting me, because if liable such defects
temper, she could not contribute much my felicity.”

“sir, you quite misunderstme,” said mrs. bennet,larmed. “lizzy is
only headstrong such matterssse. everything else she iss
good-natured girls ever lived. i will go directly mr. bennet,nd
we shall very soon settle her, im sure.”

she would not give him time reply, but hurryingstantly her
husband, called outs she entered library, “oh! mr. bennet, you
are wanted immediately; werelln uproar. you must comend make
lizzy marry mr. collins, fshe vows she will not have him,nd if you
do not make haste he will change his mindnd not have _her_.”

mr. bennet raised his eyes from his books she entered,nd fixedm
on her face calm unconcern which was not leastltered by
her communication.

“i have not pleasure understanding you,” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “whatre you talking?”

“mr. collinsnd lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins,
mr. collins begins say that he will not have lizzy.”

“whatm i do on occasion? seemsn hopeless business.”

“speak lizzybout yourself. tell her that yousist upon her
marrying him.”

“let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion.”

mrs. bennet rang bell,nd miss elizabeth was summoned
library.

“come here, child,” cried her fathers sheppeared. “i have sent for
you onnffair importance. i understthat mr. collins has made
younfer marriage. is true?” elizabeth replied that was.
“very well--offer marriage you have refused?”

“i have, sir.”

“very well. we now come point. your mothersists upon your
accepting. is not so, mrs. bennet?”

“yes, i will never see hergain.”

“an unhappylternative is before you, elizabeth. from day you must
be stranger one your parents. your mother will never see you
agaif you do _not_ marry mr. collins,nd i will never see yougain
if you _do_.”

elizabeth could not but smilet such conclusion such beginning,
but mrs. bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husbregarded
affairs she wished, was excessively disappointed.

“what do you mean, mr. bennet, talking way? you promised me
_insist_ upon her marrying him.”

“my dear,” replied her husband, “i have two small favours request.
first, that you willllow me free use my understanding on
present occasion;nd secondly, my room. i shall be glad have
library myselfs soons may be.”

not yet, however, spite her disappointment her husband, did
mrs. bennet give up point. she talked elizabethgainndgain;
coaxednd threatened her by turns. she endeavoured secure jane
herterest; but jane,ll possible mildness, declined
interfering;nd elizabeth, sometimes real earnestness,nd
sometimes playful gaiety, replied herttacks. though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating solitude on what had passed.
he thoughwell himself comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him;nd though his pride was hurt, he suffered no other
way. his regard fher was quite imaginary;nd possibility her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feelingny regret.

while family were confusion, charlotte lucas came spend
daym. she was met vestibule by lydia, who, flying
her, cried half whisper, “im glad youre come, forre is such
fun here! what do you think has happened morning? mr. collins has
madenfer lizzy,nd she will not have him.”

charlotte hardly had timenswer, beforey were joined by kitty,
who came tell same news;nd no sooner hady entered
breakfast-room, where mrs. bennet waslone, than she likewise began on
subject, calling on miss lucas fher compassion,nd entreating
her persuade her friend lizzy comply wishesll her
family. “pray do, my dear miss lucas,” shedded melancholyne,
“fnobody is on my side, nobody takes part me. im cruelly used,
nobody feels fmy ponerves.”

charlotte's reply was spared by entrance janend elizabeth.

“aye,re she comes,” continued mrs. bennet, “lookings unconcerned
as may be,nd caring no more fus than if we weret york, provided
she can have her own way. but i tell you, miss lizzy--if you take
inyour head go on refusing everyfer marriage way,
you will never get husbandtll--im sure i do not know who is
maintayou when your father is dead. i shall not beble keep
you--so i warn you. i have done you from very day. ild
you library, you know, that i should never speak yougain,
you will find mes goods my word. i have no pleasure talking
undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure,deed, talking
tonybody. people who suffers i do from nervous complaints can have
no greatclination ftalking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but
islways so. those who do not complainre never pitied.”

her daughters listened silence effusion, sensible that
anyttempt reason her sooher would onlycrease
irritation. she talked on,refore,outterruption fromny
them, tilly were joined by mr. collins, who entered room
anir more stately than usual,nd on perceiving whom, she said
girls, “now, i dosist upon, that you,ll you, hold
yourngues,nd let mend mr. collins have little conversation
together.”

elizabeth passed quietly out room, janend kitty followed, but
lydistood her ground, determined hearll she could;nd charlotte,
detained first by civility mr. collins, whosequiriesfter
herselfndll her family were very minute,ndn by little
curiosity, satisfied herself walking windownd pretending
not hear. doleful voice mrs. bennet began projected
conversation: “oh! mr. collins!”

“my dear madam,” replied he, “let us be fever silent on point.
far be from me,” he presently continued, voice that marked his
displeasure, “resent behaviour your daughter. resignation
inevitable evils is duty usll; peculiar duty

discussion mr. collins'sfer was now nearlytn end,nd
elizabeth had only suffer from uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending,nd occasionally from some peevishllusions her
mother.s fgentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment dejection, by tryingvoid her,
but by stiffness mannernd resentful silence. he scarcely ever spoke
her,ndssiduousttentions which he had been so sensible
himself were transferred frest day miss lucas, whose
civility listening him was seasonable reliefmll,nd
especially her friend.

morrow produced nobatement mrs. bennet's ill-humour ill
health. mr. collins waslso same statengry pride. elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
notppear leastffected by. he waslways have gone on
saturday,nd saturday he meant stay.

after breakfast, girls walked merytonquire if mr. wickham
were returned,nd lament over hisbsence from netherfield ball.
he joinedm onir enteringwn,ndttendedmir
aunt's where his regretnd vexation,nd concern everybody, was
well talked over. elizabeth, however, he voluntarilycknowledged
that necessity hisbsence _had_ been self-imposed.

“i found,” said he, “as time drew near that i had better not meet
mr. darcy; that be same room, same party him fso
many hoursgether, might be more than i could bear,nd that scenes
mightrise unpleasant more than myself.”

she highlypproved his forbearance,ndy had leisure ffull
discussion,nd forll commendation whichy civilly
bestowed on each other,s wickhamndnotherficer walked back
them longbourn,nd during walk he particularlyttended
her. hisccompanyingm was doubledvantage; she feltll
complimentfered herself,nd was mostcceptablesn
occasiontroducing him her fathernd mother.

soonfterir return, letter was delivered miss bennet; came
from netherfield. envelope contained sheet elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered lady's fair, flowing hand;nd
elizabeth saw her sister's countenance changes she read,nd saw
her dwellingtently on some particular passages. jane recollected
herself soon,nd putting letterway, tried joher usual
cheerfulness general conversation; but elizabeth feltnnxiety
on subject which drewf herttention even from wickham;nd no
sooner had hend his companion taken leave, than glance from jane
invited her follow her up stairs. wheny had gainedir own room,
jane, taking out letter, said:

“is from caroline bingley; what contains has surprised me good
deal. whole party have left netherfield by time,ndre on
their waywn--withoutnytention coming backgain. you
shall hear what she says.”

shen read first sentenceloud, which comprisedformation
ofir having just resolved followir brotherwn directly,
ofir meaning dine grosvenstreet, where mr. hurst had
house. next wasse words: “i do not pretend regretnything
i shall leave hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope,t some future period, enjoy many returns that
delightfultercourse we have known,nd meanwhile may
lessen paseparation by very frequentnd most unreserved
correspondence. i depend on you fthat.”se highflown
expressions elizabeth listenedllsensibility distrust;
though suddennessir removal surprised her, she saw
nothing really lament; was not be supposed thatir
absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley's beingre;nds
lossir society, she was persuaded that jane must cease
regard, enjoyment his.

“is unlucky,” said she,fter short pause, “that you should not be
able see your friends beforey leave country. but may we not
hope that period future happiness which miss bingley looks
forward mayrrive earlier than she isware,nd that delightful
intercourse you have knowns friends will be renewed yet greater
satisfactions sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained london by
them.”

“caroline decidedly says that none party will returnto
hertfordshire winter. i will read you:”

“when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that business which
took him london might be concluded three four days; buts we
are certacannot be so,ndt same time convinced that when
charles getswn he will be no hurry leavegain, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged spend
his vacant hours comfortless hotel. many mycquaintancesre
alreadyre fwinter; i wish that i could hear that you, my
dearest friend, hadnytention making one crowd--but
that i despair. i sincerely hope your christmas hertfordshire may
abound gaieties which that season generally brings,nd that your
beaux will be so numerouss prevent your feeling loss
three whom we shall deprive you.”

“is evident by,”dded jane, “that he comes back no more
winter.”

“is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he _should_.”

“why will you think so? must be his own doing. he is his own
master. but you do not know _all_. i _will_ read you passage which
particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from _you_.”

“mr. darcy is impatient see his sister;nd, confess truth,
_we_re scarcely less eager meet hergain. i really do not think
georgiandarcy has her equal fbeauty, elegance,ndccomplishments;
theffection shespires louismyself is heightenedto
something still moreteresting, from hope we dare entertain
her being hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned you my feelings on subject; but i will not leave
countryout confidingm,nd i trust you will not esteemm
unreasonable. my brotherdmires her greatlylready; he will have
frequent opportunity now seeing her on mosttimate footing;
her relationsll wish connections muchs his own;nd sister's
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable engagingny woman's heart.llse circumstances
favournttachment,nd nothing prevent,m i wrong, my dearest
jane,dulging hopen event which will secure happiness
so many?”

“what do you think _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?” said janes she
finished. “is not clear enough? does not expressly declare that
caroline neither expects nwishes me be her sister; that she is
perfectly convinced her brother'sdifference;nd that if she
suspects nature my feelings fhim, she means (most kindly!)
put me on my guard? canre beny other opinion on subject?”

“yes,re can; fmine istally different. will you hear?”

“most willingly.”

“you shall have few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is
love you,nd wants him marry miss darcy. she follows him
town hope keeping himre,nd tries persuade you that he
does not carebout you.”

jane shook her head.

“indeed, jane, you ought believe me. no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt hisffection. miss bingley, im sure, cannot. she
is not such simpleton. could she have seen halfs much love mr.
darcy fherself, she would havedered her wedding clothes. but
case is: were not rich enough grenough form;nd she
is morenxious get miss darcy fher brother, from notion
that whenre has been _one_termarriage, she may have less trouble
inchieving second; whichre is certainly somegenuity,nd
i dare say would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out way. but,
my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatlydmires miss darcy, he is smallest
degree less sensible _your_ merthan when heok leave you on
tuesday, that will be her power persuade him that,stead
being love you, he is very much love her friend.”

“if we thoughtlike miss bingley,” replied jane, “your
representationll might make me quite easy. but i know
foundation is unjust. caroline iscapable wilfully deceiving
anyone;ndll that i can hope case is that she is deceiving
herself.”

“that is right. you could not have started more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort mine. believe her be deceived, byll means.
you have now done your duty by her,nd must fret no longer.”

“but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing best,
accepting man whose sistersnd friendsrell wishing him marry
elsewhere?”

“you must decide fyourself,” said elizabeth; “if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that misery disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent happiness being his wife, idvise you by
all means refuse him.”

“how can you talk so?” said jane, faintly smiling. “you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grievedtir disapprobation, i could
not hesitate.”

“i did not think you would;nd that being case, i cannot consider
your situation much compassion.”

“but if he returns no more winter, my choice will never be
required. thousthings mayrise six months!”

idehis returning no more elizabeth treated utmost
contempt.ppeared her merely suggestion caroline's
interested wishes,nd she could not fmoment suppose that those
wishes, however openlyrtfully spoken, couldfluence young man
sotallydependent everyone.

she represented her sisters forciblys possible what she felt
on subject,nd had soon pleasure seeings happy effect.
jane's temper was not desponding,nd she was gradually led hope,
though diffidenceffection sometimes overcame hope, that
bingley would return netherfieldndnswer every wish her heart.

theygreed that mrs. bennet should only hear departure
family,out beinglarmed on score gentleman's conduct;
but even partial communication gave her great deal concern,
she bewaileds exceedingly unlucky that ladies should happen
goway justsy werell getting sotimategether.fter
lamenting, however,t some length, she had consolation that mr.
bingley would be soon downgainnd soon diningt longbourn,nd
conclusionll was comfortable declaration, that though he had
beenvited only family dinner, she would take care have two
full courses.

bennets were engaged dine lucasesndgaduring
chief day was miss lucas so kinds listen mr. collins.
elizabethokn opportunity thanking her. “keeps him good
humour,” said she, “im more obliged you than i can express.”
 charlottessured her friend her satisfaction being useful,nd
thatmply repaid her flittle sacrifice her time. was
verymiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
hadny conception;s object was nothing else than secure her
fromny return mr. collins'sddresses, by engagingmwards
herself. such was miss lucas's scheme;ndppearances were so
favourable, that wheny partedt night, she would have feltlmost
secure success if he had not been leave hertfordshire so very
soon. but here she didjustice firenddependence his
character, fled him escape out longbourn house next
morningdmirable slyness,nd hasten lucas lodge throw
himselft her feet. he wasnxiousvoid notice his cousins,
from conviction that ify saw him depart,y could not fail
conjecture his design,nd he was not willing havettempt known
tills success might be known likewise; fthough feelinglmost
secure,nd reason, fcharlotte had beenlerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident sincedventure wednesday.
his reception, however, was most flattering kind. miss lucas
perceived him fromn upper windows he walkedwards house,nd
instantly set out meet himccidentally lane. but little had
she dared hope that so much lovend eloquencewaited herre.

ins short times mr. collins's long speeches wouldllow,
everything was settled betweenm satisfaction both;nds
they entered house he earnestly entreated her name day that
was make him happiest men;nd though such solicitation must
be waived fpresent, lady felt noclination trifle
his happiness. stupidity which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship fromny charm that could make woman wish fors
continuance;nd miss lucas, whoccepted him solely from pure
disinterested desiren establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

sir williamnd lady lucas were speedilypplied forir consent;
was bestowed most joyfullacrity. mr. collins's present
circumstances made most eligible match forir daughter, whom
they could give little fortune;nd his prospects future wealth were
exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly calculate, more
interest than matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
mr. bennet was likely live;nd sir william gaves his decided
opinion, that whenever mr. collins should be possession
longbourn estate, would be highly expedient that both hend his wife
should makeirppearancet st. james's. whole family, short,
were properly overjoyed on occasion. younger girls formed hopes
_coming out_ year two sooner thany might otherwise have
done;nd boys were relieved fromirpprehension charlotte's
dyingn old maid. charlotte herself waslerably composed. she had
gained her point,nd had time consider. her reflections were
general satisfactory. mr. collins, be sure, was neither sensible
norgreeable; his society was irksome,nd histtachment her must
be imaginary. but still he would be her husband.out thinking highly
either men matrimony, marriage hadlways been her object; was
only provision fwell-educated young women small fortune,
however uncertagiving happiness, must beir pleasantest
preservative from want. preservative she had now obtained;ndt
thege twenty-seven,out having ever been handsome, she feltll
good luck. leastgreeable circumstance business
was surprise must occasion elizabeth bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond thatny other person. elizabeth would wonder,
probably would blame her;nd though her resolution was not be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. she resolved
give herformation herself,ndrefore charged mr. collins,
when he returned longbourn dinner, drop no hint what had
passed beforeny family. promise secrecy was course very
dutifully given, but could not be keptout difficulty; for
curiosity excited by his longbsence burst forth such very direct
questions on his returns required somegenuity evade,nd he was
at same time exercising great self-denial, fhe was longing
publish his prosperous love.

as he was beghis journeyo early on morrow seeny
family, ceremony leave-taking was performed when ladies moved
fnight;nd mrs. bennet, great politenessnd cordiality,
said how happyy should be see himt longbourngain, whenever
his engagements mightllow him visthem.

“my dear madam,” he replied, “invitation is particularly
gratifying, because is what i have been hoping receive;nd
you may be very certathat i shallvail myselfs soons
possible.”

they werellstonished;nd mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy return, immediately said:

“but isre not danger lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run risk
offending your patroness.”

“my dear sir,” replied mr. collins, “im particularly obliged you
ffriendly caution,nd you may depend upon my not taking so
material stepout her ladyship's concurrence.”

“you cannot beo much upon your guard. risknything rather than her
displeasure;nd if you find likely be raised by your coming us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietlyt home,
be satisfied that _we_ shall take nofence.”

“believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionatettention;nd depend upon, you will speedily receive
from me letter thanks for,nd fevery other mark your
regard during my stay hertfordshire.s fmy fair cousins, though
mybsence may not be long enough render necessary, i shall now
take liberty wishingm healthnd happiness, not excepting my
couselizabeth.”

proper civilities ladiesndrew;llm equally
surprised that he meditated quick return. mrs. bennet wished
understby that he thought paying hisddresses one her
younger girls,nd mary might have been prevailed onccept him.
she rated hisbilities much higher thanny others;re was
solidity his reflections whichten struck her,nd though by no
means so clevers herself, she thought that if encouraged read
improve himself by suchn examples hers, he might become very
agreeable companion. but on following morning, every hope
kind was doneway. miss lucas called soonfter breakfast,nd
private conference elizabeth related event day before.

possibility mr. collins's fancying himself love her
friend had once occurred elizabethlast day two; but
that charlotte could encourage him seemedlmosts far from
possibilitys she could encourage him herself,nd herstonishment was
consequently so greats overcomet first bounds decorum,nd
she could not help crying out:

“engaged mr. collins! my dear charlotte--impossible!”

steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded telling her
story, gave way momentary confusion here on receiving so direct
reproach; though,s was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure,nd calmly replied:

“why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you thinkcredible
that mr. collins should beble procureny woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happys succeed you?”

but elizabeth had now recollected herself,nd making strong effort
for, wasblessurelerable firmness that prospect
their relationship was highly grateful her,nd that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.

“i see what youre feeling,” replied charlotte. “you must be surprised,
very much surprised--so latelys mr. collins was wishing marry
you. but when you have had time think over, i hope you will be
satisfied what i have done. im not romantic, you know; i never
was. isk only comfortable home;nd considering mr. collins's
character, connection,nd situation life, im convinced that my
chance happiness him iss fairs most people can boast on
entering marriage state.”

elizabeth quietlynswered “undoubtedly;”ndfternwkward pause,
they returned rest family. charlotte did not stay much
longer,nd elizabeth wasn left reflect on what she had heard.
was long time before she becametll reconciled ideso
unsuitable match. strangeness mr. collins's making twofers
marriagethree days was nothing comparison his being now
accepted. she hadlways felt that charlotte's opinion matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed be possible
that, when calledtoction, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling worldlydvantage. charlotte wife mr. collins was
most humiliating picture!nd pang friend disgracing herself
sunk her esteem, wasdded distressing conviction that
was impossible fthat friend belerably happy lot she had
chosen.



chapter 23


elizabeth was sitting her mothernd sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard,nd doubting whether she wasuthorised mention
it, when sir william lucas himselfppeared, sent by his daughter,
announce her engagement family. many complimentsm,
much self-gratulation on prospect connection between
houses, he unfolded matter--tonudience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; fmrs. bennet, more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken;nd lydia,lways unguardednd
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

“good lord! sir william, how can you tell such story? do not you know
that mr. collins wants marry lizzy?”

nothing less than complaisance courtier could have borne
withoutnger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried
him throughll;nd though he begged leave be positives
truth hisformation, he listenedllir impertinence
most forbearing courtesy.

elizabeth, feelingcumbent on her relieve him from so unpleasant
situation, now put herself forward confirm hisccount, by
mentioning her priknowledge from charlotte herself;nd
endeavoured put stop exclamations her mothernd sisters
by earnestness her congratulations sir william, which she
was readily joined by jane,nd by making variety remarks on
happiness that might be expected from match, excellent character
mr. collins,nd convenient distance hunsford from london.

mrs. bennet was facmuch overpowered say great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he leftm than her feelings
found rapid vent. first place, she persisted disbelieving
whole matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins
had been taken; thirdly, she trusted thaty would never be
happygether;nd fourthly, that match might be brokenf. two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from whole: one, that
elizabeth was real cause mischief;nd other that she
herself had been barbarously misused bymll;nd onse two
points she principally dwelt during rest day. nothing could
consolend nothing couldppease her. ndid that day wear out her
resentment. week elapsed before she could see elizabethout
scolding her, month passedway before she could speak sir william
lady lucasout being rude,nd many months were gone before she
couldtll forgiveir daughter.

mr. bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on occasion,nd such
as he did experience he pronounced be mostgreeable sort; for
gratified him, he said, discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used thinklerably sensible, wass foolishs his wife,nd
more foolish than his daughter!

jane confessed herself little surprisedt match; but she said
less herstonishment than her earnest desire forir happiness;
ncould elizabeth persuade her considers improbable. kitty
lydiwere far from envying miss lucas, fmr. collins was only
clergyman;ndffectedm no other way thans piece news
spreadt meryton.

lady lucas could not besensible triumph on beingble retort
on mrs. bennet comfort having daughter well married;nd she
calledt longbourn rathertener than usual say how happy she was,
though mrs. bennet's sour looksnd ill-natured remarks might have been
enough drive happinessway.

between elizabethnd charlottere was restraint which keptm
mutually silent on subject;nd elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist betweenmgain. her
disappointment charlotte made her turn fonder regard her
sister, whose rectitudend delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken,nd fwhose happiness she grew daily morenxious,
as bingley had now been gone weeknd nothing more was heard his
return.

jane had sent carolinen earlynswer her letter,nd was counting
days till she might reasonably hope heargain. promised
letter thanks from mr. collinsrrived on tuesday,ddressed
their father,nd writtenll solemnity gratitude which
twelvemonth'sbode family might have prompted.fter discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceededformm, many
rapturous expressions, his happiness having obtainedffection
ofirmiable neighbour, miss lucas,ndn explained that was
merely view enjoying her society that he had been so ready
closeir kind wish seeing himgaint longbourn, whither
he hoped beble return on monday fortnight; flady catherine,
hedded, so heartilypproved his marriage, that she wished take
places soons possible, which he trusted would ben unanswerable
argument hismiable charlotte namen early day fmaking him
happiest men.

mr. collins's returnhertfordshire was no longer matter
pleasure mrs. bennet. on contrary, she wass much disposed
complains her husband. was very strange that he should come
longbournstead lucas lodge; waslso veryconvenient
exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors house
while her health was sodifferent,nd lovers werell people
most disagreeable. such were gentle murmurs mrs. bennet,nd
they gave way only greater distress mr. bingley's continued
absence.

neither jane nelizabeth were comfortable on subject. dayfter
day passedwayout bringingny other tidings him than
report which shortly prevailed meryton his coming no more
netherfield whole winter; report which highlycensed mrs.
bennet,nd which she never failed contradicts most scandalous
falsehood.

even elizabeth began fear--not that bingley wasdifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful keeping himway. unwillings
she wasdmitn ideso destructive jane's happiness,nd so
dishonorable stability her lover, she could not prevents
frequently occurring. united efforts his two unfeeling sisters

darcyndmusements london might beo much, she feared, for
strength histtachment.

as fjane, _her_nxiety under suspense was, course, more
painful than elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous
concealing,nd between herselfnd elizabeth,refore, subject
was neverlluded. buts no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed which she did not talk bingley, express her
impatience fhisrrival, even require jane confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. needed
all jane's steady mildness bearsettackslerable
tranquillity.

mr. collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight, but his
receptiont longbourn was not quite so graciouss had been on his
firsttroduction. he waso happy, however, need muchttention;
luckily fothers, business love-making relievedm
from great deal his company. chief every day was spent by
himt lucas lodge,nd he sometimes returned longbourn only time
makenpology fhisbsence before family went bed.

mrs. bennet was really most pitiable state. very mention
anything concerning match threw hertongony ill-humour,
wherever she went she was sure hearing talked. sight
miss lucas was odious her.s her successthat house, she
regarded her jealousbhorrence. whenever charlotte came see
them, she concluded her benticipating hour possession;nd
whenever she spoke low voice mr. collins, was convinced that
they were talking longbourn estate,nd resolving turn herself
her daughters out house,s soons mr. bennet were dead. she
complained bitterlyll her husband.

“indeed, mr. bennet,” said she, “is very hard think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress house, that i should be forced
make way f_her_,nd live see her take her place!”

“my dear, do not give way such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for
better things. let us flatter ourselves that i may be survivor.”

was not very consoling mrs. bennet,ndrefore,stead
makingnynswer, she went ons before.

“i cannot bear think thaty should havell estate. if was
not fentail, i should not mind.”

“what should not you mind?”

“i should not mindnythingtll.”

“let us be thankful that youre preserved from state such
insensibility.”

“i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, fornythingbout entail. how
anyone could have conscience entailwayn estate from one's own

“i leave yourself determine,” said mr. bennet.



chapter 24


miss bingley's letterrrived,nd putn end doubt. very first
sentence conveyedssuranceir beingll settled london for
winter,nd concluded her brother's regrett not having had
time pay his respects his friends hertfordshire before he left
country.

hope was over, entirely over;nd when jane couldttend rest
letter, she found little, except professedffection
writer, that could give herny comfort. miss darcy's praise occupied
chief. her manyttractions weregadwelt on,nd caroline
boasted joyfullyircreasingtimacy,nd ventured predict
theccomplishment wishes which had been unfolded her former
letter. she wrotelso great pleasure her brother's beingn
inmate mr. darcy's house,nd mentioned raptures some plans
latter regard new furniture.

elizabeth, whom jane very soon communicated chiefll,
heard silentdignation. her heart was divided between concern
fher sister,nd resentmentgainstll others. caroline's
assertion her brother's being partial miss darcy she paid no
credit. that he was really fond jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done;nd muchs she hadlways been disposed like him, she
could not thinkoutnger, hardlyout contempt, on that easiness
temper, that want proper resolution, which now made him slave
his designing friends,nd led him sacrifice his own happiness
capriceirclination. had his own happiness, however,
been only sacrifice, he might have beenllowed sport
whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's wasvolved,s
she thought he must be sensible himself. was subject, short,
on which reflection would be longdulged,nd must be unavailing. she
could think nothing else;nd yet whether bingley's regard had really
diedway, were suppressed by his friends'terference; whether
he had beenware jane'sttachment, whether had escaped his
observation; whatever were case, though her opinion him must be
materiallyffected by difference, her sister's situation remained
same, her peace equally wounded.

day two passed before jane had courage speak her feelings
elizabeth; butt last, on mrs. bennet's leavingmgether,fter
longer irritation than usualbout netherfieldnds master, she could
not help saying:

“oh, that my dear mother had more commover herself! she can have no
idepashe gives me by her continual reflections on him. but
i will not repine. cannot last long. he will be forgot,nd we shall
all bes we were before.”

elizabeth lookedt her sistercredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

“you doubt me,” cried jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have
no reason. he may live my memorys mostmiable man my
acquaintance, but that isll. i have nothing either hope fear,
nothing reproach him. thank god! i have not _that_ pain.
little time,refore--i shall certainly try get better.”

stronger voice she soondded, “i have comfort immediately,
that has not been more thann errfancy on my side,nd that
has done no harmnyone but myself.”

“my dear jane!” exclaimed elizabeth, “youreo good. your sweetness
disinterestednessre reallyngelic; i do not know what say
you. i feels if i had never done you justice, loved yous you
deserve.”

miss bennet eagerly disclaimedll extraordinary merit,nd threw back
praise on her sister's warmffection.

“nay,” said elizabeth, “is not fair. _you_ wish thinkll
world respectable,ndre hurt if i speak illnybody. i only want
think _you_ perfect,nd you set yourselfgainst. do not
befraid my runningtony excess, my encroaching on your
privilege universal good-will. you need not.rere few people
whom i really love,nd still fewer whom i think well. more i see
world, morem i dissatisfied;nd every day confirms
my beliefconsistencyll human characters,nd
little dependence that can be placed onppearance meror
sense. i have met twostances lately, one i will not mention;
other is charlotte's marriage. is unaccountable! every view is
unaccountable!”

“my dear lizzy, do not give way such feelingssse.y will
ruyour happiness. you do not makellowance enough fdifference
situationnd temper. consider mr. collins's respectability,nd
charlotte's steady, prudent character. remember that she is one
large family; thats fortune, is most eligible match;nd be
ready believe, feverybody's sake, that she may feel something like
regardnd esteem four cousin.”

“oblige you, i would try believelmostnything, but no one else
could be benefited by such beliefs; fwere i persuaded that
charlotte hadny regard fhim, i should only think worse her
understanding than i now do her heart. my dear jane, mr. collins is
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is,s wells
i do;nd you must feel,s wells i do, that woman who married him
cannot have proper way thinking. you shall not defend her, though
is charlotte lucas. you shall not, fsake onedividual,
change meaning principlendtegrity, nendeavour persuade
yourself me, that selfishness is prudence,ndsensibility
danger security fhappiness.”

“i must think your languageo strong speaking both,” replied
jane; “i hope you will be convinced by seeingm happy
together. but enough. youlluded something else. you
mentioned _two_stances. i cannot misunderstyou, but i entreat
you, dear lizzy, not pame by thinking _that person_ blame,nd
saying your opinion him is sunk. we must not be so ready fancy
ourselvestentionallyjured. we must not expect lively young man
belways so guardednd circumspect. is veryten nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. women fancydmiration means more than
does.”

“men take care thaty should.”

“if is designedly done,y cannot be justified; but i have no idea
ofre being so much design worlds some persons imagine.”

“im far fromttributingny part mr. bingley's conduct design,”
 said elizabeth; “butout scheming do wrong, make others
unhappy,re may be error,ndre may be misery. thoughtlessness,
wantttention other people's feelings,nd want resolution,
will do business.”

“do you impute either those?”

“yes; last. but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what
i think persons you esteem. stop me whilst you can.”

“you persist,n, supposing his sistersfluence him?”

“yes, conjunction his friend.”

“i cannot believe. why shouldy tryfluence him?y can
only wish his happiness;nd if he isttached me, no other woman can
secure.”

“your first position is false.y may wish many things besides his
happiness;y may wish hiscrease wealthnd consequence;y
may wish him marry girl who hasll importance money, great
connections,nd pride.”

“beyond doubt,y _do_ wish him choose miss darcy,” replied jane;
“but may be from better feelings than youre supposing.y have
known her much longer thany have known me; no wonder ify love
her better. but, whatever may beir own wishes, is very unlikely
they should have opposedir brother's. what sister would think
herselft liberty do, unlessre were something very
objectionable? ify believed himttached me,y would not try
part us; if he were so,y could not succeed. by supposing suchn
affection, you make everybodycting unnaturallynd wrong,nd me most
unhappy. do not distress me by idea. im notshamed having been
mistaken--or,t least, is light, is nothing comparison what
i should feel thinking ill him his sisters. let me take
best light, light which may be understood.”

elizabeth could not oppose such wish;nd from time mr. bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned betweenm.

mrs. bennet still continued wondernd repinet his returning no
more,nd though day seldom passed which elizabeth did notccount
fclearly,re was little chance her ever considering
less perplexity. her daughter endeavoured convince her what she
did not believe herself, that histtentions jane had been merely
effect commonnd transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more; but though probability statement wasdmittedt
time, she had same story repeat every day. mrs. bennet's best
comfort was that mr. bingley must be downgasummer.

mr. bennet treated matter differently. “so, lizzy,” said he one day,
“your sister is crossed love, i find. i congratulate her. next
being married, girl likes be crossed little love nowndn.
is something think,nd gives her sort distinction
among her companions. when is your turn come? you will hardly bear
be long outdone by jane. now is your time. herereficers enough
meryton disappointll young ladies country. let wickham
be _your_ man. he is pleasant fellow,nd would jilt you creditably.”

“thank you, sir, but lessgreeable man would satisfy me. we must not
all expect jane's good fortune.”

“true,” said mr. bennet, “but is comfort think that whatever
that kind may befall you, you havenffectionate mother who will make
most.”

mr. wickham's society was material service dispelling gloom
which late perverse occurrences had thrown on many longbourn
family.y saw himten,nd his other recommendations was now
added that general unreserve. whole what elizabeth hadlready
heard, his claims on mr. darcy,ndll that he had suffered from him,
was now openlycknowledgednd publicly canvassed;nd everybody was
pleased know how muchy hadlways disliked mr. darcy beforey
had knownnything matter.

miss bennet was only creature who could supposere might be
any extenuating circumstances case, unknown society
hertfordshire; her mildnd steady candourlways pleaded for
allowances,nd urged possibility mistakes--but by everybody else
mr. darcy was condemneds worst men.



chapter 25


after week spent professions lovend schemes felicity,
mr. collins was called from hismiable charlotte byrrival
saturday. paseparation, however, might belleviated on his
side, by preparations freception his bride;s he had reason
hope, that shortlyfter his returnhertfordshire, day would
be fixed that was make him happiest men. heok leave his
relationst longbourns much solemnitys before; wished his fair
cousins healthnd happinessgain,nd promisedir fathernother
letter thanks.

on following monday, mrs. bennet had pleasure receiving
her brothernd his wife, who cames usual spend christmas
at longbourn. mr. gardiner was sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superihis sister,s well by natures education. netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty believing that man who lived
by trade,ndview his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bredndgreeable. mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger
than mrs. bennetnd mrs. phillips, wasnmiable,telligent, elegant
woman,nd great favouritell her longbourn nieces. between
two eldestnd herself especially,re subsisted particular regard.
they had frequently been staying herwn.

first part mrs. gardiner's business on herrrival was
distribute her presentsnd describe newest fashions. when was
done she had lessctive part play. became her turn listen.
mrs. bennet had many grievances relate,nd much complain.y
hadll been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. two her
girls had been upon point marriage,ndfterllre was
nothing.

“i do not blame jane,” she continued, “fjane would have got mr.
bingley if she could. but lizzy! oh, sister! is very hard think
that she might have been mr. collins's wife by time, had not
been fher own perverseness. he made hernfer very room,
she refused him. consequence is, that lady lucas will have
daughter married before i have,nd that longbourn estate is just
as much entaileds ever. lucasesre veryrtful peopledeed,
sister.yrell fwhaty can get. im sorry say
them, but so is. makes me very nervousnd poorly, be thwarted
so my own family,nd have neighbours who thinkmselves
beforenybody else. however, your coming justt time is
greatest comforts,nd im very glad hear what you tell us,
long sleeves.”

mrs. gardiner, whom chief news had been given before,
course janend elizabeth's correspondence her, made her
sister slightnswer,nd, compassion her nieces, turned
conversation.

whenlone elizabethfterwards, she spoke more on subject. “it
seems likely have been desirable match fjane,” said she. “im
sorry wentf. butse things happen soten! young man, such
as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls love pretty girl
ffew weeks,nd whenccident separatesm, so easily forgets
her, thatse sortconsistenciesre very frequent.”

“an excellent consolations way,” said elizabeth, “but will not
do f_us_. we do not suffer by _accident_. does notten
happen thatterference friends will persuade young man
independent fortune think no more girl whom he was violently
love only few days before.”

“but that expression 'violently love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, sodefinite, that gives me very little idea. iss
oftenpplied feelings whichrise from half-hour'scquaintance,
as real, strongttachment. pray, how _violent was_ mr. bingley's
love?”

“i never saw more promisingclination; he was growing quite
inattentive other people,nd wholly engrossed by her. every time
they met, was more decidednd remarkable.t his own ball he
offended two three young ladies, by notskingm dance;nd i
spoke him twice myself,out receivingnnswer. couldre be
finer symptoms? is not generalcivility very essence love?”

“oh, yes!--that kind love which i suppose him have felt. poor
jane! im sorry fher, because, her disposition, she may not get
over immediately. had better have happened _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out sooner. but do you think she
would be prevailed upon go back us? change scene might be
service--perhaps little relief from home may bes usefuls
anything.”

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased proposal,nd felt persuaded
her sister's readycquiescence.

“i hope,”dded mrs. gardiner, “that no consideration regard
young man willfluence her. we live so different part
town,ll our connectionsre so different,nd,s you well know, we go
out so little, that is very improbable thaty should meettll,
unless he really comes see her.”

“_that_ is quite impossible; fhe is now custody his
friend,nd mr. darcy would no more suffer him call on jane such
part london! my dearunt, how could you think? mr. darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ such places gracechurch street, but he
would hardly think month'sblution enough cleanse him froms
impurities, were he once enter;nd depend upon, mr. bingley
never stirsout him.”

“so much better. i hopey will not meettll. but does not jane
correspond his sister? _she_ will not beble help calling.”

“she will dropcquaintance entirely.”

but spite certainty which elizabethffected place
point,s wells still moreteresting one bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt solicitude on subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider entirely
hopeless. was possible,nd sometimes she thought probable, that
hisffection might be reanimated,ndfluence his friends
successfully combated by more naturalfluence jane's
attractions.

miss bennetccepted herunt'svitation pleasure;nd
bingleys were no otherwise her thoughtst same time, thans she
hoped by caroline's not living same house her brother,
she might occasionally spend morning her,outny danger
seeing him.

gardiners stayed weekt longbourn;nd what phillipses,
lucases,ndficers,re was not dayouts
engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided fentertainment
her brothernd sister, thaty did not once sdown family
dinner. when engagement was fhome, someficerslways
made part--whichficers mr. wickham was sure be one;nd
onse occasions, mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation, narrowly observedm both.out supposingm,
from what she saw, be very seriously love,ir preference
each other was plaenough make her little uneasy;nd
she resolved speak elizabeth on subject before she left
hertfordshire,nd represent her imprudence encouraging such
anttachment.

mrs. gardiner, wickham had one meansffording pleasure,
unconnected his general powers.bout ten dozen yearsgo,
before her marriage, she had spent considerable time that very
part derbyshire which he belonged.y had,refore, many
acquaintances common;nd though wickham had been littlere since
death darcy's father, was yet his power give her fresher
intelligence her former friends than she had been way
procuring.

mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley,nd known late mr. darcy by
character perfectly well. here consequently wasnexhaustible subject
discourse. comparing her recollection pemberley minute
description which wickham could give,nd bestowing her tribute
praise on characters late possessor, she was delighting both
himnd herself. on being madecquainted present mr. darcy's
treatment him, she tried remember some that gentleman's
reputed disposition when quite lad which mightgree,nd
was confidentt last that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam
darcy formerly spokens very proud, ill-natured boy.



chapter 26


mrs. gardiner's caution elizabeth was punctuallynd kindly given
on first favourable opportunity speaking herlone;fter
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

“youreo sensible girl, lizzy, fall love merely because
youre warnedgainst;nd,refore, im notfraid speaking
openly. seriously, i would have you be on your guard. do notvolve
yourself endeavourvolve himnffection which want
fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing saygainst
_him_; he is mostteresting young man;nd if he had fortune he
ought have, i should think you could not do better. buts is, you
must not let your fancy runway you. you have sense,nd well
expect you use. your father would depend on _your_ resolutionnd
good conduct, im sure. you must not disappoint your father.”

“my dearunt, is being seriousdeed.”

“yes,nd i hope engage you be serious likewise.”

“well,n, you need not be undernylarm. i will take care
myself,nd mr. wickhamo. he shall not be love me, if i
can prevent.”

“elizabeth, youre not serious now.”

“i beg your pardon, i will trygain.t present im not love
mr. wickham; no, i certainlym not. but he is, beyondll comparison,
mostgreeable man i ever saw--if he becomes reallyttached
me--i believe will be better that he should not. i see imprudence
of. oh! _that_bominable mr. darcy! my father's opinion me does
me greatest honour,nd i should be miserable forfeit. my
father, however, is partial mr. wickham. short, my dearunt, i
should be very sorry be means makingny you unhappy; but
since we see every day that wherere isffection, young people
are seldomheld by immediate want fortune from enteringto
engagements each other, how can i promise be wiser than so many
my fellow-creatures if im tempted, howm i even know that
would be wisdom resist?ll that i can promise you,refore, is not
be hurry. i will not be hurry believe myself his first
object. when im company him, i will not be wishing. short,
i will do my best.”

“perhaps will bes well if you discourage his coming here so very
often.t least, you should not _remind_ your motherviting him.”

“as i did other day,” said elizabeth conscious smile: “very
true, will be wise me refrafrom _that_. but do not imagine
that he islways here soten. is on yourccount that he has been
so frequentlyvited week. you know my mother's ideass
necessity constant company fher friends. but really,nd upon my
honour, i will try do what i think be wisest;nd now i hope
youre satisfied.”

heruntssured her that she was,nd elizabeth having thanked her for
kindness her hints,y parted; wonderfulstancedvice
being given on such point,out being resented.

mr. collins returnedhertfordshire soonfter had been quitted
by gardinersnd jane; buts heok up hisbode lucases,
hisrrival was no greatconvenience mrs. bennet. his marriage was
now fastpproaching,nd she wast length so far resigneds think
inevitable,nd even repeatedly say,n ill-naturedne, that
she “_wished_y might be happy.” thursday was be wedding day,
on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit;nd when she
rose take leave, elizabeth,shamed her mother's ungraciousnd
reluctant good wishes,nd sincerelyffected herself,ccompanied her
out room.sy went downstairsgether, charlotte said:

“i shall depend on hearing from you veryten, eliza.”

“_that_ you certainly shall.”

“i havenother favoursk you. will you comend see me?”

“we shallten meet, i hope, hertfordshire.”

“im not likely leave kent fsome time. promise me,refore,
come hunsford.”

elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure
visit.

“my fathernd mariare coming me march,”dded charlotte, “i
hope you will consent be party.deed, eliza, you will bes
welcomes eitherm.”

weddingok place; bridend bridegroom setf fkent from
church door,nd everybody hads much say, hear, on
subjects usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend;ndir
correspondence wass regularnd frequents had ever been; that
should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could never
address herout feeling thatll comforttimacy was over,
though determined not slackens correspondent, was for
sake what had been, rather than what was. charlotte's first letters
were received good deal eagerness;re could not but be
curiosity know how she would speak her new home, how she would
like lady catherine,nd how happy she would dare pronounce herself
be; though, when letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactlys she might have foreseen. she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded comforts,nd mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. house, furniture, neighbourhood,nd
roads, werell her taste,nd lady catherine's behaviour was most
friendlynd obliging. was mr. collins's picture hunsfordnd
rosings rationally softened;nd elizabeth perceived that she must wait
fher own visthere know rest.

jane hadlready written few lines her sisternnounceir
saferrival london;nd when she wrotegain, elizabeth hoped
would be her power say something bingleys.

her impatience fsecond letter wass well rewardeds impatience
generally is. jane had been weekwnout either seeing
hearing from caroline. sheccounted for, however, by supposing that
her last letter her friend from longbourn had by someccident been
lost.

“myunt,” she continued, “is going-morrowthat part
town,nd i shall take opportunity calling grosvenstreet.”

she wrotegawhen viswas paid,nd she had seen miss bingley.
“i did not think caroline spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
glad see me,nd reproached me fgiving her no notice my coming
london. i was right,refore, my last letter had never reached
her. iquiredfterir brother, course. he was well, but so much
engaged mr. darcy thaty scarcely ever saw him. i found that
miss darcy was expected dinner. i wish i could see her. my viswas
not long,s carolinend mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shall
seem soon here.”

elizabeth shook her head over letter. convinced her that
accident only could discover mr. bingley her sister's beingwn.

four weeks passedway,nd jane saw nothing him. she endeavoured
persuade herself that she did not regret; but she could no longer be
blind miss bingley'sattention.fter waitingt home every morning
ffortnight,ndventing every evening fresh excuse fher,
visitdidt lastppear; but shortness her stay,nd yet more,
thelteration her manner wouldllow jane deceive herself no
longer. letter which she wrote on occasion her sister will
prove what she felt.

“my dearest lizzy will, im sure, becapable triumphing her
better judgement,t my expense, when i confess myself have been
entirely deceived miss bingley's regard fme. but, my dear sister,
though event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i
stillssert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as naturals your suspicion. i do nottll comprehend her reason for
wishing betimate me; but if same circumstances were
happengain, im sure i should be deceivedgain. caroline did not
return my vistill yesterday;nd not note, not line, did i
receive meantime. when she did come, was very evident that
she had no pleasure; she made slight, formalpology, fnot
calling before, said not word wishing see megain,nd was
every respect soltered creature, that when she wentway i was
perfectly resolved continuecquaintance no longer. i pity,
though i cannot help blaming her. she was very wrong singling me out
as she did; i can safely say that everydvancetimacy began on
her side. but i pity her, because she must feel that she has beencting
wrong,nd because im very sure thatnxiety fher brother is
cause. i need not explamyself farther;nd though _we_ know
thisnxiety be quite needless, yet if she feels, will easily
account fher behaviour me;nd so deservedly dears he is
his sister, whatevernxiety she must feel on his behalf is naturalnd
amiable. i cannot but wonder, however,t her havingny such fears now,
because, if he hadtll caredbout me, we must have met, longgo.
he knows my beingwn, im certain, from something she said
herself;nd yet would seem, by her manner talking,s if she
wanted persuade herself that he is really partial miss darcy. i
cannot understand. if i were notfraid judging harshly, i should
belmost tempted say thatre is strongppearance duplicity
inll. but i will endeavour banish every painful thought,
think only what will make me happy--yourffection,nd
invariable kindness my dear unclendunt. let me hear from you very
soon. miss bingley said something his never returning netherfield
again, giving up house, but notny certainty. we had better
not mention. im extremely glad that you have such pleasantccounts
from our friendst hunsford. pray go seem, sir williamnd
maria. im sure you will be very comfortablere.--yours, etc.”

letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returneds she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by sistert least.
all expectation from brother was nowbsolutely over. she would not
even wish frenewal histtentions. his character sunk on
every review;nds punishment fhim,s wells possible
advantage jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.
darcy's sister,s by wickham'sccount, she would make himbundantly
regret what he had thrownway.

mrs. gardinerbout time reminded elizabeth her promise
concerning that gentleman,nd requiredformation;nd elizabeth
had such sends might rather give contentment herunt than
herself. hispparent partiality had subsided, histtentions were over,
he wasdmirer some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough
seell, but she could seend writeout material pain.
her heart had been but slightlyuched,nd her vanity was satisfied
believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted. suddencquisition ten thouspounds was most
remarkable charm young lady whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps case than
charlotte's, did not quarrel him fhis wishdependence.
nothing, on contrary, could be more natural;nd whileble
suppose that cost him few struggles relinquish her, she was
readyllow wisend desirable measure fboth,nd could very
sincerely wish him happy.

all wascknowledged mrs. gardiner;ndfter relating
circumstances, she thus went on: “im now convinced, my dearunt, that
i have never been much love; fhad i really experienced that pure
elevating passion, i shouldt present detest his very name,nd

though everything seemed neatnd comfortable, she was notble

when mr. collins saidnything which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, shevoluntarily turned her
eye on charlotte. once twice she could discern faint blush; but

from his garden, mr. collins would have ledm round his two meadows;

probably, have opportunity showingout her husband's

was fitted upndrranged neatnessnd consistency which
elizabeth gave charlottell credit. when mr. collins could be
forgotten,re was reallynir great comfort throughout,nd by
charlotte's evident enjoyment, elizabeth supposed he must beten

she hadlready learnt that lady catherine was still country.

in, observed:

“yes, miss elizabeth, you will have honour seeing lady catherine

doubt not but you will be honoured some portion her notice

charming. we dinet rosings twice every week,ndre neverllowed

_should_ say, one her ladyship's carriages, fshe has several.”

“lady catherine is very respectable, sensible womandeed,”dded
charlotte, “mostttentive neighbour.”

“very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say. she is sort
woman whom one cannot regardo much deference.”

evening was spent chiefly talking over hertfordshire news,
tellinggawhat hadlready been written;nd when closed,
elizabeth, solitude her chamber, had meditate upon
charlotte's degree contentment, understherddress guiding,

wasll done very well. she hadlsonticipate how her visit
would pass, quiet tenofir usual employments, vexatious

about middle next day,s she was her room getting ready

up stairs violent hurry,nd calling loudlyfter her. she opened
doornd met marilanding place, who, breathless
agitation, cried out--

“oh, my dear eliza! pray make hastend comedining-room, for
there is such sight be seen! i will not tell you what is. make

elizabethsked questions vain; mariwould tell her nothing more,

quest wonder; was two ladies stopping low phaetont
garden gate.

“isll?” cried elizabeth. “i expectedt least that pigs
were gotgarden,nd here is nothing but lady catherinend her
daughter.”

“la! my dear,” said maria, quite shockedt mistake, “is not
lady catherine. old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who livesm;
other is miss de bourgh. only lookt her. she is quite little
creature. who would have thought that she could be so thinnd small?”

“she isbominably rude keep charlotte out doorsll wind.
why does she not come?”

“oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does. is greatest favours
when miss de bourgh comes.”

“i like herppearance,” said elizabeth, struck other ideas. “she
looks sicklynd cross. yes, she will do fhim very well. she will
make him very proper wife.”

mr. collinsnd charlotte were both standingt gate conversation

stationed doorway, earnest contemplation greatness
before him,nd constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
way.

at lengthre was nothing more be said; ladies drove on,nd
others returnedhouse. mr. collins no sooner saw two
girls than he began congratulatem onir good fortune, which
charlotte explained by lettingm know that whole party wassked

chapter 29


mr. collins's triumph, consequencevitation, was complete.
power displaying grandeur his patroness his wondering
visitors,nd lettingm see her civilitywards himselfnd his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for;nd thatn opportunity
doing should be given so soon, was suchnstance lady
catherine's condescension,s he knew not howdmire enough.

“i confess,” said he, “that i should not have beentll surprised by
her ladyship'ssking us on sunday drink tespend eveningt
rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge herffability, that
would happen. but who could have foreseen suchnttentions? who
could have imagined that we should receivenvitation dinere
(anvitation, moreover,cluding whole party) so immediately
after yourrrival!”

“im less surprisedt what has happened,” replied sir william,
“from that knowledge what manners great reallyre, which
my situation life hasllowed mecquire.bout court, such
instances elegant breedingre not uncommon.”

scarcelynything was talked whole day next morning butir
visrosings. mr. collins was carefullystructingm what
they were expect, that sight such rooms, so many servants,nd
so splendid dinner, might not wholly overpowerm.

when ladies were separating ftoilette, he said elizabeth--

“do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin,bout yourpparel. lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance dress us which
becomes herselfnd her daughter. i woulddvise you merely put on
whatever your clothes is superirest--there is no occasion
fornything more. lady catherine will not think worse you
fbeing simply dressed. she likes have distinction rank
preserved.”

whiley were dressing, he came two three timesir different
doors, recommendir being quick,s lady catherine very much
objected be kept waiting fher dinner. such formidableccounts
her ladyship,nd her manner living, quite frightened marilucas
who had been little used company,nd she looked forward her
introductiont rosingss muchpprehensions her father had done

as weather was fine,y had pleasant walkbout half
milecross park. every park hass beautynds prospects;nd
elizabeth saw much be pleased, though she could not be such
rapturess mr. collins expected scenespire,nd was but
slightlyffected by his enumeration windows front
house,nd his relation what glazingltogether hadiginally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.

whenyscended steps hall, maria'slarm was every
momentcreasing,nd even sir william did not look perfectly calm.
elizabeth's courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing lady
catherine that spoke herwful fromny extraordinary talents
miraculous virtue,nd mere stateliness money rank she thought
she could witnessout trepidation.

from entrance-hall, which mr. collins pointed out,

followed servants throughnnte-chamber, room where lady
catherine, her daughter,nd mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship,
great condescension,rose receivem;nds mrs. collins had
settled her husbthatficetroduction should
be hers, was performed proper manner,outny those
apologiesnd thanks which he would have thought necessary.

spite having beent st. james's, sir william was so completely
awed by grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough make very low bow,nd take his seatout saying word;
his daughter, frightenedlmost out her senses, sat on edge
her chair, not knowing which way look. elizabeth found herself
quite equal scene,nd could observe three ladies before her
composedly. lady catherine was tall, large woman, strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. herir was not
conciliating, nwas her manner receivingm suchs make her
visitors forgetirferirank. she was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she said was spoken southoritativene,
as marked her self-importance,nd brought mr. wickham immediately
elizabeth's mind;nd from observation dayltogether, she
believed lady catherine be exactly what he represented.

when,fter examining mother, whose countenancend deportment
she soon found some resemblance mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on
daughter, she couldlmost have joined maria'sstonishmentt her
being so thinnd so small.re was neither figure nfaceny
likeness between ladies. miss de bourgh was palend sickly; her
features, though not plain, weresignificant;nd she spoke very
little, except low voice, mrs. jenkinson, whoseppearance
there was nothing remarkable,nd who was entirely engaged listening
what she said,nd placing screen proper direction before
her eyes.

after sitting few minutes,y werell sent one windows

dinner was exceedingly handsome,ndre werell servantsnd

likewise foretold, heok his seatt bottom table, by her
ladyship's desire,nd lookeds if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. he carved,ndte,nd praised delighted
alacrity;nd every dish was commended, first by himndn by sir
william, who was now enough recovered echo whatever his son-in-law
said, manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.
but lady catherine seemed gratified byir excessivedmiration,nd
gave most gracious smiles, especially whenny dish on table proved

was ready speak wheneverre wasn opening, but she was seated
between charlottend miss de bourgh--former whom was engaged
listening lady catherine,nd latter said not word herll
dinner-time. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed watching how little
miss de bourghte, pressing her try some other dish,nd fearing
she wasdisposed. marithought speaking out question,nd
gentlemen did nothing but eatnddmire.

when ladies returned drawing-room,re was little
be done but hear lady catherine talk, which she didoutny
intermission till coffee came, delivering her opinion on every
subject so decisive manner,s proved that she was not used
have her judgement controverted. shequiredcharlotte's domestic
concerns familiarlynd minutely, gave her great dealdvices

beneath great lady'sttention, which could furnish hern
occasion dictating others.tervals her discourse
mrs. collins, sheddressed variety questions mariand
elizabeth, but especially latter, whose connections she knew
least,nd who she observed mrs. collins was very genteel,
pretty kind girl. shesked her,t different times, how many sisters
she had, whethery were older younger than herself, whetherny
them were likely be married, whethery were handsome, wherey
had been educated, what carriage her father kept,nd what had been
her mother's maiden name? elizabeth feltll impertinence

observed,

“oh!n--some time other we shall be happy hear you. our

“onem does.”

“why did not youll learn? you oughtll have learned. miss

“no, nottll.”

“that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mother

“my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london.”

“has your governess left you?”

“we never hadny governess.”

“no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought upt home
without governess! i never heard such thing. your mother must
have been quite slave your education.”

elizabeth could hardly help smilings shessured her that had not been

“then, who taught you? whottended you?out governess, you

“compared some families, i believe we were; but such uss

“yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps _she_ is full young be

“upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly

“three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your

lady catherine seemed quitestonishedt not receiving directnswer;
elizabeth suspected herself be first creature who had ever
dared trifle so much dignified impertinence.

“you cannot be more than twenty, im sure,refore you need not

“im not one-and-twenty.”

when gentlemen had joinedm,nd tewas over, card-tables
were placed. lady catherine, sir william,nd mr.nd mrs. collins sat
down quadrille;nds miss de bourgh chose playt cassino,

uttered that did not relate game, except when mrs. jenkinson
expressed her fears miss de bourgh's beingo hocold,

was employedgreeing everything her ladyship said, thanking her

charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than really was. but her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
mr. collins,nd he was very soon obliged take her ladyship's praise
inhis own hands.



chapter 30


sir william stayed only weekt hunsford, but his viswas long
enough convince him his daughter's being most comfortably settled,
her possessing such husbandnd such neighbours were not
often met. while sir william wasm, mr. collins devoted his
morning driving him out his gig,nd showing him country; but
when he wentway, whole family returnedir usual employments,
elizabeth was thankful find thaty did not see more her
cousbylteration, fchief time between breakfast
dinner was now passed by him eithert work garden
readingnd writing,nd looking out window his own book-room,
which fronted road. room which ladies sat was backwards.
elizabeth hadt first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
dining-parlour fcommon use; was better sized room,nd had
more pleasantspect; but she soon saw that her friend hadn excellent
reason fwhat she did, fmr. collins would undoubtedly have been
much less his ownpartment, hady sat one equally lively;nd
she gave charlotte credforrrangement.

from drawing-roomy could distinguish nothing lane,nd
weredebted mr. collins fknowledge what carriages went
along,nd howten especially miss de bourgh drove by her phaeton,
which he never failed comingformm, though happened
almost every day. she not unfrequently stoppedt parsonage,nd
had few minutes' conversation charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon get out.

very few days passed which mr. collins did not walk rosings,nd
not many which his wife did not think necessary go likewise;
till elizabeth recollected thatre might be other family livings
be disposed, she could not understsacrifice so many
hours. nowndny were honoured call from her ladyship,
nothing escaped her observation that was passing room during
these visits. she examinedtoir employments, lookedtir work,
anddvisedm do differently; found faultrrangement
furniture; detected housemaid negligence;nd if she
acceptedny refreshment, seemed do only fsake finding
out that mrs. collins's joints meat wereo large fher family.

elizabeth soon perceived, that though great lady was not
commission peace county, she was mostctive magistrate
her own parish, minutest concerns which were carried her
by mr. collins;nd wheneverny cottagers were disposed
be quarrelsome, discontented,o poor, she sallied forthto
village settleir differences, silenceir complaints,nd scold
themharmonynd plenty.

entertainment diningt rosings was repeatedbout twice week;
and,llowing floss sir william,ndre being only one
card-table evening, every such entertainment was counterpart
first.ir other engagements were few,s style living
neighbourhood general was beyond mr. collins's reach.,
however, was no evil elizabeth,nd upon whole she spent her time
comfortably enough;re were half-hours pleasant conversation
charlotte,nd weather was so fine ftime year that she had
often great enjoyment out doors. her favourite walk,nd where she
frequently went while others were calling on lady catherine, was
along open grove which edged that side park, wherere was
nice sheltered path, which no one seemed value but herself,nd
where she felt beyond reach lady catherine's curiosity.

quiet way, first fortnight her vissoon passedway.
easter waspproaching,nd week preceding was bringn
addition familyt rosings, which so small circle must be
important. elizabeth had heard soonfter herrrival that mr. darcy was
expectedre course few weeks,nd thoughre were not
many hercquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new looktir rosings parties,nd
she might bemused seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour his cousin, fwhom he was evidently
destined by lady catherine, who talked his coming greatest
satisfaction, spoke him terms highestdmiration,nd
seemedlmostngry find that he hadlready been frequently seen by
miss lucasnd herself.

hisrrival was soon knownt parsonage; fmr. collins was walking
whole morningview lodges openinghunsford lane,
inder have earliestssurance,ndfter making his
bows carriage turnedpark, hurried home great
intelligence. on following morning he hastened rosings pay his
respects.re were two nephews lady catherine requirem, for
mr. darcy had brought him colonel fitzwilliam, younger son
his uncle lord ----,nd, great surprisell party, when
mr. collins returned, gentlemenccompanied him. charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing road,nd immediately running
inother,ld girls whatn honoury might expect,dding:

“i may thank you, eliza, fpiece civility. mr. darcy would
never have come so soon waupon me.”

elizabeth had scarcely time disclaimll right compliment,
beforeirpproach wasnnounced by door-bell,nd shortly
afterwards three gentlemen entered room. colonel fitzwilliam,
who led way, wasbout thirty, not handsome, but personnd
address most truly gentleman. mr. darcy looked justs he had been
used look hertfordshire--paid his compliments, his usual
reserve, mrs. collins,nd whatever might be his feelingsward her
friend, met her everyppearance composure. elizabeth merely
curtseyed himout saying word.

colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very muchdmiredt parsonage,
ladiesll felt that he mustdd considerably pleasures
ofir engagementst rosings. was some days, however, beforey
receivednyvitation thither--fwhilere were visitors
house,y could not be necessary;nd was not till easter-day,
almost weekfter gentlemen'srrival, thaty were honoured by
suchnttention,ndny were merelysked on leaving church
comere evening. flast weeky had seen very little
lady catherine her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had calledt
parsonage more than once during time, but mr. darcyy had seen
onlyt church.

invitation wasccepted course,ndt proper houry joined
party lady catherine's drawing-room. her ladyship received
them civilly, but was plathatir company was by no means so
acceptables when she could get nobody else;nd she was, fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speakingm, especially darcy,
much more thanny other person room.

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad seem;nything was
welcome relief himt rosings;nd mrs. collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. he now seated himself by her,nd
talked sogreeably kentnd hertfordshire, travellingnd staying
at home, new booksnd music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained that room before;ndy conversed so much
spiritnd flow,s drawttention lady catherine herself,
as wells mr. darcy. _his_ eyes had been soonnd repeatedly turned
towardsm look curiosity;nd that her ladyship,fter
while, shared feeling, was more openlycknowledged, fshe did not
scruple call out:

“what is that youre saying, fitzwilliam? what is youre talking
of? whatre you telling miss bennet? let me hear what is.”

“were speaking music, madam,” said he, when no longerblevoid
reply.

“music!n pray speakloud. isll subjects my delight. i
must have my share conversation if youre speaking music.
therere few people england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
music than myself, better natural taste. if i had ever learnt,
i should have been great proficient.nd so wouldnne, if her health
hadllowed herpply. im confident that she would have performed
delightfully. how does georgianget on, darcy?”

mr. darcy spokeffectionate praise his sister's proficiency.

“im very glad hear such goodccount her,” said lady
catherine; “pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect excel
if she does not practice good deal.”

“issure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need suchdvice.
she practises very constantly.”

“so much better. cannot be doneo much;nd when i next write
her, i shall charge her not neglect onnyccount. iten
tell young ladies that no excellence music is becquiredout
constant practice. i haveld miss bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more;nd though mrs.
collins has nostrument, she is very welcome,s i havetenld
her, come rosings every day,nd play on pianoforte mrs.
jenkinson's room. she would be nobody's way, you know, that part
house.”

mr. darcy looked littleshamed hisunt's ill-breeding,nd made
nonswer.

when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth having
promised play him;nd she sat down directlystrument. he
drew chair near her. lady catherine listened half song,ndn
talked,s before, her other nephew; till latter walkedway
from her,nd making his usual deliberationwards pianoforte
stationed himself sos commfull view fair performer's
countenance. elizabeth saw what he was doing,ndt first
convenient pause, turned himnrch smile,nd said:

“you mean frighten me, mr. darcy, by comingll state hear
me? i will not belarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.re
is stubbornnessbout me that never can bear be frightenedt

“i shall not say youre mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not

had pleasure yourcquaintance long enough know that you find
great enjoyment occasionally professing opinions which factre
not your own.”

elizabeth laughed heartilyt picture herself,nd said
colonel fitzwilliam, “your couswill give you very pretty notion
me,nd teach you not believe word i say. im particularly unlucky
meeting person soble expose my real character, part
world where i had hoped pass myselff some degree

that you knew my disadvantage hertfordshire--and, give me leave
say, very impolitico--fis provoking me retaliate,nd such
things may come outs will shock your relations hear.”

“im notfraid you,” said he, smilingly.

“pray let me hear what you haveccuse him,” cried colonel
fitzwilliam. “i should like know how he behavesmong strangers.”

“you shall hearn--but prepare yourself fsomething very dreadful.
first time my ever seeing him hertfordshire, you must know,
wast ball--andt ball, what do you think he did? he danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;nd, my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down want
partner. mr. darcy, you cannot deny fact.”

“i had nott that time honour knowingny ladyssembly
beyond my own party.”

“true;nd nobody can ever betroduced ball-room. well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wayourders.”

“perhaps,” said darcy, “i should have judged better, had i soughtn
introduction; but im ill-qualified recommend myself strangers.”

“shall wesk your cousreason?” said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam. “shall wesk him why man sensend
education,nd who has lived world, is ill qualified recommend
himself strangers?”

“i cannswer your question,” said fitzwilliam, “withoutpplying
him. is because he will not give himself trouble.”

“i certainly have not talent which some people possess,” said darcy,
“conversing easily those i have never seen before. i cannot
catchirne conversation,ppearterestedir
concerns,s iten see done.”

“my fingers,” said elizabeth, “do not move overstrument
masterly manner which i see so many women's do.y have not same
force rapidity,nd do not produce same expression. butn i
havelways supposed be my own fault--because i will not take
trouble practising. is not that i do not believe _my_ fingerss
capablesny other woman's superiexecution.”

darcy smilednd said, “youre perfectly right. you have employed your
time much better. no onedmitted privilege hearing you can
thinknything wanting. we neither us perform strangers.”

herey wereterrupted by lady catherine, who called out know
whaty were talking. elizabeth immediately began playinggain.
lady catherinepproached,nd,fter listening ffew minutes, said
darcy:

“miss bennet would not playtllmiss if she practised more,nd
could havedvantage london master. she has very good notion
fingering, though her taste is not equalnne's.nne would have
been delightful performer, had her healthllowed her learn.”

elizabeth lookedt darcy see how cordially hessented his
cousin's praise; but neithert that moment nortny other could she
discernny symptom love;nd from whole his behaviour miss
de bourgh she derived comfort fmiss bingley, that he might have
been justs likely marry _her_, had she been his relation.

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
withm manystructions on executionnd taste. elizabeth received
themll forbearance civility,nd,t request
gentlemen, remainedtstrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready takemll home.



chapter 32


elizabeth was sitting by herself next morning,nd writing jane
while mrs. collinsnd mariwere gone on businessvillage,
when she was startled by ringt door, certasignal
visitor.s she had heard no carriage, she thought not unlikely
be lady catherine,nd under thatpprehension was puttingway her
half-finished letter that she might escapell impertinent questions,
when doopened,nd, her very great surprise, mr. darcy,nd
mr. darcy only, entered room.

he seemedstonishedo on finding herlone,ndpologised fhis
intrusion by letting her know that he had understoodll ladies were
bein.

theyn sat down,nd when herquiriesfter rosings were made,
seemed danger sinkingtotal silence. wasbsolutely
necessary,refore, think something,nd emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last hertfordshire,nd
feeling curious know what he would say on subjectir hasty
departure, she observed:

“how very suddenly youll quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!
must have been mostgreeable surprise mr. bingley see you
allfter him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but day
before. hend his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?”

“perfectly so, i thank you.”

she found that she was receive no othernswer,nd,fter short
pausedded:

“i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much ideever
returning netherfieldgain?”

“i have never heard him say so; but is probable that he may spend
very little his timere future. he has many friends,nd
ist time life when friendsnd engagementsre continually
increasing.”

“if he means be but littlet netherfield, would be better for
neighbourhood that he should give up place entirely, forn we
might possibly get settled familyre. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
not take house so much fconvenience neighbourhoods
fhis own,nd we must expect him keep quon same
principle.”

“i should not be surprised,” said darcy, “if he were give ups
soonsny eligible purchasefers.”

elizabeth made nonswer. she wasfraid talking longer his
friend;nd, having nothing else say, was now determined leave
trouble finding subject him.

heok hint,nd soon began, “seems very comfortable
house. lady catherine, i believe, did great deal when mr.
collins first came hunsford.”

“i believe she did--im sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on more grateful object.”

“mr. collinsppears be very fortunate his choice wife.”

“yes,deed, his friends may well rejoice his having met one
very few sensible women who would haveccepted him, have made
him happy ify had. my friend hasn excellent understanding--though
im not certathat i consider her marrying mr. collinss
wisest thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy, however,nd
prudential light is certainly very good match fher.”

“must be verygreeable fher be settledso easy
distance her own familynd friends.”

“an easy distance, do you call? is nearly fifty miles.”

“what is fifty miles good road? little more than half day's
journey. yes, i call _very_ easy distance.”

“i should never have considered distances one _advantages_
match,” cried elizabeth. “i should never have said mrs. collins
was settled _near_ her family.”

“is proyour ownttachment hertfordshire.nything beyond
very neighbourhood longbourn, i suppose, wouldppear far.”

as he spokere was sort smile which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her be thinking janend
netherfield,nd she blusheds shenswered:

“i do not mean say that woman may not be settledo near her
family. farnd near must be relative,nd depend on many
varying circumstances. wherere is fortune make expenses
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. but that is not
case _here_. mr.nd mrs. collins have comfortablecome, but not
such ones willllow frequent journeys--im persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
present distance.”

mr. darcy drew his chair littlewards her,nd said, “_you_ cannot
have right such very strong localttachment. _you_ cannot have
beenlwayst longbourn.”

elizabeth looked surprised. gentleman experienced some change
feeling; he drew back his chair,ok newspaper from table,nd
glancing over, said, colder voice:

“are you pleased kent?”

short dialogue on subject country ensued, on either side
calmnd concise--soon putn end by entrance charlotte
her sister, just returned from her walk. tete-a-tete surprised
them. mr. darcy related mistake which had occasioned histruding
on miss bennet,ndfter sitting few minutes longerout saying
muchnybody, wentway.

“what can be meaning?” said charlotte,s soons he was
gone. “my dear, eliza, he must be love you, he would never
have called us familiar way.”

but when elizabethld his silence, did not seem very likely,
even charlotte's wishes, be case;ndfter various
conjectures,y couldt last only suppose his visproceed from
difficulty findingnything do, which was more probable
from time year.ll field sports were over.doorsre
was lady catherine, books,nd billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always bedoors;nd nearness parsonage,
pleasantness walk, people who lived,
two cousins found temptation from period walking thither
almost every day.y calledt various times morning, sometimes
separately, sometimesgether,nd nowndnccompanied byir
aunt. was plainmll that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasureir society, persuasion which course recommended
him still more;nd elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction
being him,s wells by his evidentdmiration her, her
former favourite george wickham;nd though, comparingm, she saw
there was less captivating softness colonel fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have bestformed mind.

but why mr. darcy came soten parsonage, was more difficult
understand. could not be fsociety,s he frequently satre
ten minutesgetherout opening his lips;nd when he did speak,
seemed effect necessity rather than choice--sacrifice
propriety, not pleasure himself. he seldomppeared really
animated. mrs. collins knew not what make him. colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughingt his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge him could not haveld
her;nds she would liked have believed change effect
love,nd object that love her friend eliza, she set herself
seriously work find out. she watched him whenevery weret
rosings,nd whenever he came hunsford; butout much success. he
certainly lookedt her friend great deal, but expression that
look was disputable. wasn earnest, steadfast gaze, but sheten
doubted whetherre were muchdmiration,nd sometimes
seemed nothing butbsence mind.

she had once twice suggested elizabeth possibility his
being partial her, but elizabethlways laughedt idea;nd mrs.
collins did not think right press subject, from danger
raising expectations which might only end disappointment; fher
opiniondmitted not doubt, thatll her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him be her power.


her kind schemes felizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam. he was beyond comparison most pleasant man; he
certainlydmired her,nd his situation life was most eligible; but,
counterbalancesedvantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
church,nd his couscould have nonetll.



chapter 33


more than once did elizabeth, her ramblepark,
unexpectedly meet mr. darcy. she feltll perverseness
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought,nd,
prevents ever happeninggain,ok careform himt first that
was favourite haunt hers. how could occur second time,

fitzwilliam his thoughts? she supposed, if he meantnything, he must
meannllusion what mightrise that quarter. distressed
her little,nd she was quite glad find herselft gate
pales opposite parsonage.

she was engaged one days she walked, perusing jane's last letter,
dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written
spirits, when,stead beinggasurprised by mr. darcy, she saw
on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her. puttingway
letter immediatelynd forcing smile, she said:

“i did not know before that you ever walked way.”

“i have been makingur park,” he replied, “as i generally
do every year,ndtend close callt parsonage.re
you going much farther?”

“no, i should have turned moment.”

andccordingly she did turn,ndy walkedwards parsonage
together.

“do you certainly leave kent on saturday?” said she.

“yes--if darcy does not putfgain. but imt his disposal. he
arranges business justs he pleases.”

“if notble please himselfrrangement, he hast least
pleasure great power choice. i do not knownybody who seems
more enjoy power doing what he likes than mr. darcy.”

“he likes have his own way very well,” replied colonel fitzwilliam.
“but so well do. is only that he has better means having
than many others, because he is rich,nd many othersre poor. i speak
feelingly. younger son, you know, must beured self-denialnd
dependence.”

“my opinion, younger sonn earl can know very little
either. now seriously, what have you ever known self-denialnd
dependence? when have you been prevented by want money from going
wherever you chose, procuringnything you had fancy for?”

“thesere home questions--perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships that nature. but matters greater
weight, i may suffer from want money. younger sons cannot marry where
they like.”

“unless wherey like women fortune, which i thinky veryten
do.”

“our habits expense make uso dependent,ndrere not many
my rank life who canfford marryout somettention
money.”

“is,” thought elizabeth, “meant fme?”nd she colouredt
idea; but, recovering herself, said livelyne, “pray, what
is usual pricen earl's younger son? unless elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would notskbove fifty thouspounds.”

henswered her same style,nd subject dropped.terrupt
silence which might make him fancy herffected what had passed,
she soonfterwards said:

“i imagine your cousbrought you down him chiefly fsake
having someonet his disposal. i wonder he does not marry, secure
lasting convenience that kind. but, perhaps, his sister doess well
fpresent,nd,s she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes her.”

“no,” said colonel fitzwilliam, “that isndvantage which he must
divide me. im joined him guardianship miss darcy.”

“are youdeed?nd pray what sort guardians do you make? does your
charge give you much trouble? young ladies hergere sometimes
little difficult manage,nd if she has true darcy spirit, she
may like have her own way.”

as she spoke she observed him lookingt her earnestly;nd manner
which he immediatelysked her why she supposed miss darcy likely
givemny uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow other
got pretty near truth. she directly replied:

“you need not be frightened. i never heardny harm her;nd i dare
say she is one most tractable creatures world. she is
very great favourite some ladies mycquaintance, mrs. hurstnd
miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you knowm.”

“i knowm little.ir brother is pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
is great friend darcy's.”

“oh! yes,” said elizabeth drily; “mr. darcy is uncommonly kind mr.
bingley,nd takes prodigious deal care him.”

“care him! yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care him
those points where he most wants care. from something that held me
our journey hither, i have reason think bingley very muchdebted
him. but i ought beg his pardon, fi have no right suppose that
bingley was person meant. wasll conjecture.”

“what is you mean?”

“is circumstance which darcy could not wish be generally known,
because if were get round lady's family, would ben
unpleasant thing.”

“you may depend upon my not mentioning.”

“remember that i have not much reason fsupposing be
bingley. what held me was merely: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved friend fromconveniences most
imprudent marriage, butout mentioning namesny other
particulars,nd i only suspected be bingley from believing
him kind young man getscrape that sort,nd from
knowingm have beengether whole last summer.”

“did mr. darcy give you reasons finterference?”

“i understood thatre were some very strong objectionsgainst
lady.”

“whatrts did he use separatem?”

“he did not talk me his ownrts,” said fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
onlyld me what i have nowld you.”

elizabeth made nonswer,nd walked on, her heart swelling
indignation.fter watching her little, fitzwilliamsked her why she
was so thoughtful.

“im thinking what you have been telling me,” said she. “your
cousin's conduct does not sumy feelings. why was he be judge?”

“youre rather disposed call histerferenceficious?”

“i do not see what right mr. darcy had decide on propriety his
friend'sclination, why, upon his own judgementlone, he was
determinend direct what manner his friend was be happy.
but,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none
particulars, is not fair condemn him. is not be supposed
thatre was muchffection case.”

“that is notn unnatural surmise,” said fitzwilliam, “but is
lessening honour my cousin's triumph very sadly.”

was spoken jestingly; butppeared her so just picture
mr. darcy, that she would not trust herselfnnswer,nd
therefore,bruptly changing conversation talked ondifferent
matters untily reached parsonage.re, shuther own room,
as soonsir visitleftm, she could thinkoutterruption
ofll that she had heard. was not be supposed thatny other
people could be meant than those whom she was connected.re
could not exist world _two_ men over whom mr. darcy could have
such boundlessfluence. that he had been concerned measures
taken separate bingleynd jane she had never doubted; but she had
alwaysttributed miss bingley principal designndrrangement
ofm. if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
cause, his pridend caprice were cause,ll that jane had
suffered,nd still continued suffer. he had ruined fwhile
every hope happiness fmostffectionate, generous heart
world;nd no one could say how lastingn evil he might haveflicted.

“there were some very strong objectionsgainst lady,” were colonel
fitzwilliam's words;nd those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was countryttorney,ndnother who was
business london.

“jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility
objection;ll lovelinessnd goodnesss she is!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved,nd her manners captivating. neither
couldnything be urgedgainst my father, who, though some
peculiarities, hasbilities mr. darcy himself need not disdain,nd
respectability which he will probably never reach.” when she thought
her mother, her confidence gave way little; but she would notllow
thatny objections _there_ had material weight mr. darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive deeper wound from want
importance his friend's connections, than fromir want sense;
she was quite decided,t last, that he had been partly governed
by worst kind pride,nd partly by wish retaining mr.
bingley fhis sister.

thegitationnd tears which subject occasioned, brought on
headache;nd grew so much worsewards evening, that,dded
her unwillingness see mr. darcy, determined her notttend her
cousins rosings, wherey were engaged drink tea. mrs. collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her gonds much
as possible prevented her husbfrom pressing her; but mr. collins
could not conceal hispprehension lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her stayingt home.



chapter 34


wheny were gone, elizabeth,s iftending exasperate herself
as muchs possiblegainst mr. darcy, chose fher employment
examinationll letters which jane had written her since her
being kent.y contained noctual complaint, nwasreny
revival past occurrences,ny communication present suffering.
butll,ndlmost every line each,re was want that
cheerfulness which had been used characterise her style,nd which,
proceeding from serenity mindt easeselfnd kindly
disposedwards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying ideuneasiness,n
attention which had hardly received on first perusal. mr. darcy's
shameful boast what misery he had beenbleflict, gave her
keener sense her sister's sufferings. was some consolation
think that his visrosings was end on dayfter
next--and, still greater, that less than fortnight she should
herself be janegain,nd enabled contribute recovery
her spirits, byll thatffection could do.

she could not think darcy's leaving kentout remembering that
his couswas go him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made clear
that he had notentionstll,ndgreeables he was, she did not
mean be unhappybout him.

while settling point, she was suddenly roused by sound
door-bell,nd her spirits were little fluttered by ideofs
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late
evening,nd might now comequire particularlyfter her.
but idewas soon banished,nd her spirits were very differently
affected, when, her uttermazement, she saw mr. darcy walkto
room.n hurried manner he immediately begannquiryfter her
health, imputing his viswish hearing that she were better.
shenswered him cold civility. he sat down ffew moments,nd
then getting up, walkedbout room. elizabeth was surprised, but
said not word.fter silence several minutes, he camewards her
inngitated manner,nd thus began:

“vai have struggled. will not do. my feelings will not be
repressed. you mustllow me tell you howrdently idmirend love
you.”

elizabeth'sstonishment was beyond expression. she stared, coloured,
doubted,nd was silent. he considered sufficient encouragement;
thevowalll that he felt,nd had long felt fher,
immediately followed. he spoke well; butre were feelings besides
those heart be detailed;nd he was not more eloquent on
subject tenderness than pride. his sense herferiority--of
its being degradation--family obstacles which hadlways
opposedclination, were dwelt on warmth which seemed due
consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely recommend his
suit.

spite her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not besensible
compliment such man'sffection,nd though hertentions did
not vary fornstant, she wast first sorry fpahe was
receive; till, roused resentment by his subsequent language, she
lostll compassionnger. she tried, however, compose herself
answer him patience, when he should have done. he concluded
representing her strength thatttachment which, spite
ofll his endeavours, he had found impossible conquer;nd
expressing his hope that would now be rewarded by hercceptance
his hand.s he said, she could easily see that he had no doubt
favourablenswer. he _spoke_pprehensionndnxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. such circumstance could
only exasperate farther,nd, when he ceased, colour roseher
cheeks,nd she said:

“such casess, is, i believe, established mode
express sense obligation fsentimentsvowed, however
unequallyy may be returned. is natural that obligation should
be felt,nd if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you. but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion,nd you have certainly
bestowed most unwillingly. im sorry have occasioned pain
anyone. has been most unconsciously done, however,nd i hope will be
short duration. feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
thecknowledgment your regard, can have little difficulty
overcomingfter explanation.”

mr. darcy, who was leaninggainst mantelpiece his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed catch her words no less resentment than
surprise. his complexion became palenger,nd disturbance
his mind was visible every feature. he was struggling for
appearance composure,nd would not open his lips till he believed

continued:

he even lookedt her smileffectedcredulity.

“can you deny that you have done?” she repeated.

withssumed tranquillity hen replied: “i have no wish denying
that i did everything my power separate my friend from your

“but is not merelyffair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
is founded. long before had taken place my opinion you was

under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”

“you taken eagerterest that gentleman's concerns,” said darcy,
less tranquilne,nd heightened colour.

“who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feelingn

“his misfortunes!” repeated darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes

“yourfliction,” cried elizabeth energy. “you have reduced

his walk,nd turningwards her, “thesefenses might have been

elizabeth felt herself growing morengry every moment; yet she tried
utmost speak composure when she said:

“youre mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that mode your
declarationffected meny other way, thans spared me concern
which i might have felt refusing you, had you behaved more

elizabethwoke next morning same thoughtsnd meditations
which hadt length closed her eyes. she could not yet recover from
surprise what had happened; was impossible thinknything
else;nd,tallydisposed femployment, she resolved, soonfter
breakfast,dulge herselfirnd exercise. she was proceeding
directly her favourite walk, when recollection mr. darcy's
sometimes comingre stopped her,ndstead entering park,
she turned up lane, which led farther from turnpike-road.
park paling was still boundary on one side,nd she soon passed one
gatesground.

after walking two three timeslong that part lane, she was
tempted, by pleasantness morning, stopt gatesnd
lookpark. five weeks which she had now passed kent had
made great difference country,nd every day wasdding
verdure early trees. she was on point continuing her walk,
when she caught glimpse gentlemansort grove which
edged park; he was moving that way;nd, fearfuls being mr.
darcy, she was directly retreating. but person whodvanced was now
near enough see her,nd stepping forward eagerness, pronounced
her name. she had turnedway; but on hearing herself called, though
voice which proved be mr. darcy, she movedgainwards
gate. he had by that time reachedlso,nd, holding out letter,
which shestinctivelyok, said, look haughty composure,
“i have been walking grove some time hope meeting you.
will you do me honour reading that letter?”ndn,
slight bow, turnedgainplantation,nd was soon out sight.

no expectation pleasure, but strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened letter,nd, her stillcreasing wonder,
perceivedn envelope containing two sheets letter-paper, written
quite through, very close hand. envelopeself was likewise
full. pursuing her waylong lane, shen began. was dated
from rosings,t eight o'clock morning,nd wass follows:--

“be notlarmed, madam, on receiving letter, bypprehension
ofs containingny repetition those sentiments renewal those
offers which were last night so disgusting you. i writeoutny

effort which formationnd perusal letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required be written
read. you must,refore, pardon freedom which i demand
yourttention; your feelings, i know, will bestow unwillingly, but i
demyour justice.

“twofenses very different nature,nd by no means equal
magnitude, you last night laid my charge. first mentioned was,
that, regardless sentiments either, i had detached mr. bingley
from your sister,nd other, that i had, defiance various
claims, defiance honournd humanity, ruined immediate
prosperitynd blasted prospects mr. wickham. wilfullynd
wantonly have thrownf companion my youth,cknowledged
favourite my father, young man who had scarcelyny other
dependence than on our patronage,nd who had been brought up expect
its exertion, would be depravity, which separation two young
persons, whoseffection could be growth only few weeks, could
bear no comparison. but from severity that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope
be future secured, when followingccount myctions
their motives has been read. if, explanationm, which
is due myself, im under necessity relating feelings which
may befensive yours, i can only say that im sorry. necessity
must be obeyed,nd furtherpology would bebsurd.

“i had not been long hertfordshire, before i saw, common
others, that bingley preferred your elder sisterny other young
woman country. but was not till evening dance
at netherfield that i hadnypprehension his feeling serious
attachment. i hadten seen him love before.t that ball, while i
had honour dancing you, i was first madecquainted, by sir
william lucas'sccidentalformation, that bingley'sttentions
your sister had given rise general expectationir marriage.
he spokes certaevent, which timelone could
be undecided. from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour
attentively;nd i couldn perceive that his partiality fmiss
bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed him. your sister ilso
watched. her looknd manners were open, cheerful,nd engagings ever,
butoutny symptom peculiar regard,nd i remained convinced
from evening's scrutiny, that though she received histtentions
pleasure, she did notvitem byny participation
sentiment. if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have been
error. your superiknowledge your sister must make latter
probable. if be so, if i have been misled by such errinflict
paon her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. but i shall not
scruplessert, that serenity your sister's countenancend
air was suchs might have given mostcute observer conviction
that, howevermiable her temper, her heart was not likely be
easilyuched. that i was desirous believing herdifferent is
certain--but i will venture say that myvestigationnd decisions
are not usuallyfluenced by my hopes fears. i did not believe
her bedifferent because i wished; i believed on impartial
conviction,s trulys i wished reason. my objections
marriage were not merely those which i last nightcknowledged have
utmost force passion putside, my own case; want
connection could not be so greatn evil my friends me. but
there were other causes repugnance; causes which, though still
existing,nd existingn equal degree bothstances, i had
myself endeavoured forget, becausey were not immediately before
me.se causes must be stated, though briefly. situation your
mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing comparison that
total want propriety so frequently, solmost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters,nd occasionally even by your
father. pardon me. pains mefend you. butmidst your concern
fdefects your nearest relations,nd your displeasuret
representationm, let give you consolation consider that,
have conducted yourselves sosvoidny share like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on yound your elder sister, than
is honourable sensend disposition both. i will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinionll parties
was confirmed,nd everyducement heightened which could have led
me before, preserve my friend from what i esteemed most unhappy
connection. he left netherfield flondon, on day following,s
you, im certain, remember, design soon returning.

“part which icted is now be explained. his sisters' uneasiness
had been equally excited my own; our coincidence feeling was
soon discovered,nd,like sensible that no time was be lost
detachingir brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly

pointing out my friend certaevils such choice. i
described,nd enforcedm earnestly. but, however remonstrance
might have staggered delayed his determination, i do not suppose
that would ultimately have prevented marriage, had not been
seconded byssurance that i hesitated not giving, your
sister'sdifference. he had before believed her return his
affection sincere, if not equal regard. but bingley has great
natural modesty, stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. convince him,refore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. persuade himgainst returningto
hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely
work moment. i cannot blame myself fhaving done thus much.re
is but one part my conduct wholeffair on which i do not
reflect satisfaction; is that i condescendeddopt
measuresrt so fars conceal from him your sister's being
town. i knew myself,s was known miss bingley; but her
brother is even yet ignorant. thaty might have metout
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did notppear me
enough extinguished fhim see herout some danger. perhaps
concealment, disguise was beneath me; is done, however,nd
was done fbest. on subject i have nothing more say, no
otherpologyfer. if i have wounded your sister's feelings,
was unknowingly donend though motives which governed me may
you very naturallyppearsufficient, i have not yet learnt condemn
them.

“respect that other, more weightyccusation, havingjured
mr. wickham, i can only refute by laying before you whole his
connection my family. what he has _particularly_ccused me i
am ignorant; but truth what i shall relate, i can summon more
than one witness undoubted veracity.

“mr. wickham is son very respectable man, who had fmany

chapter 36


if elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her letter, did not expect
contarenewal hisfers, she had formed no expectationtll
its contents. but suchsy were, may well be supposed how eagerly
she went throughm,nd what contrariety emotiony excited.
her feelingss she read were scarcely be defined.mazement did
she first understthat he believednypology be his power;
steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
give, which just sense shame would not conceal. strong
prejudicegainst everything he might say, she began hisccount what
had happenedt netherfield. she readn eagerness which hardly
left her power comprehension,nd from impatience knowing what
next sentence might bring, wascapablettending sense
one before her eyes. his belief her sister'ssensibility she
instantly resolved be false;nd hisccount real, worst
objections match, made herongry haveny wish doing
him justice. he expressed no regret fwhat he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. wasll pridend
insolence.

but when subject was succeeded by hisccount mr. wickham--when
she read somewhat clearerttention relation events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion his worth,nd which
bore solarmingnffinity his own history himself--her
feelings were yet morecutely painfulnd more difficult definition.
astonishment,pprehension,nd even horror, oppressed her. she wished
discredentirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “must be false!
cannot be! must be grossest falsehood!”--when she had
gone through whole letter, though scarcely knowingnything
last page two, put hastilyway, protesting that she would not
regard, that she would never lookgain.

perturbed state mind, thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but would not do; half minute letter
was unfoldedgain,nd collecting herselfs wells she could, she
agabegan mortifying perusalll that related wickham,nd
commanded herself so fars examine meaning every sentence.
theccount his connection pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself;nd kindness late mr. darcy, though
she had not before knowns extent,greed equally well his own
words. so far each recital confirmed other; but when she came
will, difference was great. what wickham had said living
was fresh her memory,nds she recalled his very words, was
impossible not feel thatre was gross duplicity on one side
other;nd, ffew moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. but when she readnd re-read closestttention,
particulars immediately following wickham's resigningll pretensions
living, his receiving lieu so considerable sums three
thouspounds,gawas she forced hesitate. she put down
letter, weighed every circumstance what she meant be
impartiality--deliberated on probability each statement--but
little success. on both sides was onlyssertion.gashe read
on; but every line proved more clearly thatffair, which she had
believed impossible thatny contrivance could so represents
render mr. darcy's conduct less thanfamous, was capable
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout whole.

extravagancend general profligacy which he scrupled not layt
mr. wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; more so,s she could
bring no proofsjustice. she had never heard him before his
entrance----shire militia, which he had engagedt
persuasion young man who, on meeting himccidentallywn,
hadre renewed slightcquaintance. his former way life
nothing had been known hertfordshire but what held himself.s
his real character, hadformation been her power, she had
never felt wishquiring. his countenance, voice,nd manner had
established himt once possession every virtue. she tried
recollect somestance goodness, some distinguished traof
integrity benevolence, that might rescue him fromttacks
mr. darcy;t least, by predominance virtue,tone fthose
casual errors under which she would endeavour class what mr. darcy
had describeds idlenessnd vice many years' continuance. but
no such recollection befriended her. she could see himstantly before
her, every charmirndddress; but she could remember no more
substantial good than generalpprobation neighbourhood,nd
regard which his social powers had gained him mess.fter
pausing on point considerable while, she once more continued
read. but,las! story which followed, his designs on miss
darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliamnd herself only morning before;ndt last she was
referred ftruth every particular colonel fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously receivedformation his
near concernll his cousin'sffairs,nd whose character she had no
reason question.t one time she hadlmost resolved onpplying
him, but idewas checked bywkwardnesspplication,nd
at length wholly banished by conviction that mr. darcy would never
have hazarded such proposal, if he had not been wellssured his
cousin's corroboration.

she perfectly remembered everything that had passed conversation
between wickhamnd herself,ir first eveningt mr. phillips's.
many his expressions were still fresh her memory. she was _now_
struck impropriety such communications stranger,nd
wondered had escaped her before. she sawdelicacy putting
himself forwards he had done,ndconsistency his professions
his conduct. she remembered that he had boasted having no fear
seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave country, but that
_he_ should sthis ground; yet he hadvoided netherfield ball
very next week. she rememberedlso that, till netherfield
family had quitted country, he hadld his story no one but
herself; but thatfterir removal had been everywhere discussed;
that he hadn no reserves, no scruples sinking mr. darcy's
character, though he hadssured her that respect ffather would
always prevent his exposing son.

how differently did everything nowppear which he was concerned!
histtentions miss king were now consequence views solelynd
hatefully mercenary;nd mediocrity her fortune proved no longer
moderation his wishes, but his eagerness grasptnything.
his behaviour herself could now have had nolerable motive; he had
either been deceived regard her fortune, had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. every lingering struggle his favour grew fainter
fainter;nd farther justification mr. darcy, she could not
butllow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had longgo
asserted his blamelessnessffair; that proudnd repulsives
were his manners, she had never, whole courseir
acquaintance--ancquaintance which had latterly broughtm much
together,nd given her sorttimacy his ways--seennything
that betrayed him be unprincipled unjust--anything that spoke him
irreligious immoral habits; thatmong his own connections he was
esteemednd valued--that even wickham hadllowed him merits
brother,nd that she hadten heard him speak soffectionately his
sisters prove him capable _some_miable feeling; that had his
actions been what mr. wickham representedm, so gross violation
everything right could hardly have been concealed from world;nd
that friendship between person capable,nd suchnmiable man
as mr. bingley, wascomprehensible.

she grewbsolutelyshamed herself. neither darcy nwickham
could she thinkout feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

“how despicably i havected!” she cried; “i, who have prided myself
on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on mybilities! who have
often disdained generous candour my sister,nd gratified
my vanity useless blameable mistrust! how humiliating is
discovery! yet, how just humiliation! had i been love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind! but vanity, not love, has been my
folly. pleased preference one,ndfended by neglect
other, on very beginning ourcquaintance, i have courted
prepossessionnd ignorance,nd driven reasonway, where either were
concerned. till moment i never knew myself.”

from herself jane--from jane bingley, her thoughts were line
which soon brought her recollection that mr. darcy's explanation
_there_ hadppeared verysufficient,nd she readgain. widely
different was effect second perusal. how could she deny that
credhisssertions onestance, which she had been obliged
give other? he declared himself betally unsuspicious her
sister'sttachment;nd she could not help remembering what charlotte's
opinion hadlways been. neither could she deny justice his
description jane. she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed,nd thatre was constant complacency herir
manner notten united great sensibility.

when she came that part letter which her family were
mentioned terms such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
shame was severe. justice charge struck hero forcibly
fdenial,nd circumstances which he particularlylludeds
having passedt netherfield ball,nds confirmingll his first
disapprobation, could not have made stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

compliment herselfnd her sister was not unfelt. soothed,
but could not console her fcontempt which had thus been
self-attracted by rest her family;nds she considered
that jane's disappointment had fact been work her nearest
relations,nd reflected how materially credboth must be hurt
by such impropriety conduct, she felt depressed beyondnything she
had ever known before.

after wanderinglong lane ftwo hours, giving way every
variety thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
reconciling herself,s wells she could, change so suddennd
so important, fatigue,nd recollection her longbsence, made
hert length return home;nd she entered house wish
ofppearing cheerfuls usual,nd resolution repressing such
reflectionss must make her unffconversation.

she was immediatelyld that two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during herbsence; mr. darcy, only ffew minutes, take
leave--but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sittingmt least
an hour, hoping fher return,ndlmost resolving walkfter her

two gentlemen left rosings next morning,nd mr. collins having
been waiting near lodges, makem his parting obeisance, was
able bring home pleasingtelligence,irppearing very
good health,ndslerable spiritss could be expected,fter
melancholy scene so lately gone throught rosings. rosings hen
hastened, console lady catherinend her daughter;nd on his return
brought back, great satisfaction, message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dulls make her very desirous
havingmll dine her.

elizabeth could not see lady catherineout recollecting that, had
she chosen, she might by time have been presented hers
her future niece; ncould she think,out smile, what her
ladyship'sdignation would have been. “what would she have said? how
would she have behaved?” were questions which shemused herself.

their first subject was diminution rosings party. “issure
you, i feel exceedingly,” said lady catherine; “i believe no one
feels loss friends so muchs i do. but im particularly
attachedse young men,nd knowm be so muchttached
me!y were excessively sorry go! but soylwaysre.
dear colonel rallied his spiritslerably till justt last; but darcy
seemed feel mostcutely, more, i think, than last year. his
attachment rosings certainlycreases.”

mr. collins had compliment,ndnllusion throw here, which
were kindly smiled on by mothernd daughter.

lady catherine observed,fter dinner, that miss bennet seemed out
spirits,nd immediatelyccounting fby herself, by supposing that
she did not like go homegaso soon, shedded:

“but if that is case, you must write your mothernd beg that
you may stay little longer. mrs. collins will be very glad your
company, im sure.”

“im much obliged your ladyship fyour kindvitation,” replied
elizabeth, “but is not my powerccept. i must bewn
next saturday.”

“why,t that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. i expected
you stay two months. ild mrs. collins so before you came.re
can be no occasion fyour going so soon. mrs. bennet could certainly
spare you fornother fortnight.”

“but my father cannot. he wrote last week hurry my return.”

“oh! your father course may spare you, if your mother can. daughters
are never so much consequence father.nd if you will stay
another _month_ complete, will be my power take one yous
fars london, fim goingre early june, fweek;nds
dawson does not object barouche-box,re will be very good room
fone you--indeed, if weather should happen be cool, i
should not object taking you both,s youre neither you large.”

“yourell kindness, madam; but i believe we mustbide by our
original plan.”

lady catherine seemed resigned. “mrs. collins, you must send servant
withm. you know ilways speak my mind,nd i cannot bear idea
two young women travelling post bymselves. is highly improper.
you must contrive send somebody. i have greatest dislike
world that sort thing. young women shouldlways be properly
guardedndttended,ccordingir situation life. when my
niece georgianwent ramsgate last summer, i made point her
having two men-servants go her. miss darcy, daughter
mr. darcy, pemberley,nd ladynne, could not haveppeared
propriety different manner. im excessivelyttentivell those
things. you must send john young ladies, mrs. collins. i
am glad occurred me mention; fwould really be
discreditable _you_ letm golone.”

“my uncle is send servant fus.”

“oh! your uncle! he keeps man-servant, does he? im very glad you
have somebody who thinksse things. where shall you change horses?
oh! bromley, course. if you mention my namet bell, you will be
attended.”

lady catherine had many other questionssk respectingir journey,
ands she did notnswermll herself,ttention was necessary,
which elizabeth believed be lucky fher;, mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection must be
reserved fsolitary hours; whenever she waslone, she gave way
as greatest relief;nd not day went byout solitary
walk, which she mightdulgell delight unpleasant
recollections.

mr. darcy's letter she was fair way soon knowing by heart. she
studied every sentence;nd her feelingswardss writer weret
times widely different. when she remembered style hisddress,
she was still fulldignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemnednd upbraided him, hernger was turnedgainst
herself;nd his disappointed feelings became object compassion.
histtachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could notpprove him; ncould she fmoment repent her refusal,
feel slightestclination ever see himgain. her own past
behaviour,re was constant source vexationnd regret;nd
unhappy defects her family, subject yet heavier chagrin.
they were hopeless remedy. her father, contented laughingt
them, would never exert himself restrawild giddiness his
youngest daughters;nd her mother, manners so far from right
herself, was entirelysensible evil. elizabeth had frequently
united janen endeavour check imprudence catherine
lydia; but whiley were supported byir mother'sdulgence,
what chance couldre be improvement? catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable,nd completely under lydia's guidance, had beenlways
affronted byirdvice;nd lydia, self-willednd careless, would
scarcely givem hearing.y were ignorant, idle,nd vain. while
there wasnficer meryton,y would flirt him;nd while
meryton waswalk longbourn,y would be goingre
forever.

anxiety on jane's behalf wasnother prevailing concern;nd mr. darcy's
explanation, by restoring bingleyll her former good opinion,
heightened sense what jane had lost. hisffection was proved
have been sincere,nd his conduct clearedll blame, unlessny
couldttach implicitness his confidence his friend. how
grievousn was thought that, situation so desirable every
respect, so repletedvantage, so promising fhappiness, jane had
been deprived, by follynddecorum her own family!

whense recollections wasdded development wickham's
character, may be easily believed that happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so muchffecteds make
almost impossible fherppearlerably cheerful.

their engagementst rosings weres frequent during last week
her staysy had beent first. very last evening was spent
there;nd her ladyshipgainquired minutelyparticulars
their journey, gavem directionss best method packing,
was so urgent on necessity placing gowns only right
way, that marithought herself obliged, on her return, undoll
work morning,nd pack her trunkfresh.

wheny parted, lady catherine, great condescension, wishedm
good journey,ndvitedm come hunsfordganext year;
miss de bourgh exerted herself so fars curtseynd hold out her
hboth.



chapter 38


on saturday morning elizabethnd mr. collins met fbreakfast few
minutes before othersppeared;nd heok opportunity
paying parting civilities which he deemeddispensably necessary.

“i know not, miss elizabeth,” said he, “whether mrs. collins has yet
expressed her sense your kindness coming us; but im very
certayou will not leave houseout receiving her thanks for
it. favour your company has been much felt, issure you. we
know how littlere is temptnyone our humblebode. our plain
manner living, our small roomsnd few domestics,nd little we
see world, must make hunsford extremely dull young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful fcondescension,
that we have done everything our power prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.”

elizabeth was eager her thanksndssurances happiness. she
had spent six weeks great enjoyment;nd pleasure being
charlotte,nd kindttentions she had received, must make _her_
feel obliged. mr. collins was gratified,nd more smiling
solemnity replied:

“gives me great pleasure hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. we have certainly done our best;nd most fortunately
having our powertroduce you very superisociety,nd,
from our connection rosings, frequent means varying
humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford
viscannot have been entirely irksome. our situation regard
lady catherine's family isdeed sort extraordinarydvantage
blessing which few can boast. you see on what footing were. you
see how continually were engagedre. truth i mustcknowledge
that,ll disadvantages humble parsonage, i should
not thinknyonebidingn object compassion, whileyre
sharers ourtimacyt rosings.”

words weresufficient felevation his feelings;nd he was
obliged walkbout room, while elizabeth tried unite civility
truth few short sentences.

“you may, fact, carry very favourable report usto
hertfordshire, my dear cousin. i flatter myselft least that you will
beble do so. lady catherine's greatttentions mrs. collins you
have been daily witness;ndltogether i trust does notppear
that your friend has drawnn unfortunate--but on point will be
as well be silent. only let messure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity
marriage. my dear charlottend i have but one mindnd one way
thinking.re is everything most remarkable resemblance
characternd ideas between us. we seem have been designed feach
other.”

elizabeth could safely say that was great happiness where that was
case,nd equal sincerity coulddd, that she firmly believed
rejoiced his domestic comforts. she was not sorry, however,
have recitalmterrupted by lady from whomy sprang.
pocharlotte! was melancholy leave her such society! but she
had chosen her eyes open;nd though evidently regretting that
her visitors were go, she did not seemsk fcompassion. her
homend her housekeeping, her parishnd her poultry,ndllir
dependent concerns, had not yet lostir charms.

at length chaiserrived, trunks were fastened on, parcels
placedin,nd was pronounced be ready.fternffectionate
parting between friends, elizabeth wasttended carriage by
mr. collins,ndsy walked down garden he was commissioning her
his best respectsll her family, not forgetting his thanks
fkindness he had receivedt longbourn winter,nd his
compliments mr.nd mrs. gardiner, though unknown. hen handed her
in, marifollowed,nd dowas on point being closed,
when he suddenly remindedm, some consternation, thaty had
hitherforgotten leaveny message fladiest rosings.

“but,” hedded, “you will course wish have your humble respects
deliveredm, your grateful thanks forir kindness you
while you have been here.”

elizabeth made no objection; dowasnllowed be shut,nd
carriage drovef.

“good gracious!” cried maria,fter few minutes' silence, “seems
but day two since we first came!nd yet how many things have
happened!”

“great manydeed,” said her companion sigh.

“we have dined nine timest rosings, besides drinking tethere twice!
how much i shall have tell!”

elizabethdded privately, “how much i shall have conceal!”

their journey was performedout much conversation,nylarm;nd
withfour hoursir leaving hunsfordy reached mr. gardiner's
house, wherey were remafew days.

jane looked well,nd elizabeth had little opportunity studying her
spirits,midst various engagements which kindness her
aunt had reserved form. but jane was go home her,ndt
longbournre would be leisure enough fobservation.

was notoutn effort, meanwhile, that she could waeven for
longbourn, before sheld her sister mr. darcy's proposals. know
that she had power revealing what would so exceedinglystonish
jane,nd must,t same time, so highly gratify whatever her own
vanity she had not yet beenble reasonway, was such temptation
opennesss nothing could have conquered but statedecision
which she remaineds extent what she should communicate;
her fear, if she once entered on subject, being hurried
inrepeating something bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.



chapter 39


was second week may, which three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street ftown ----, hertfordshire;
and,sy drew nearppointedn where mr. bennet's carriage
was meetm,y quickly perceived,ken coachman's
punctuality, both kittynd lydilooking out dining-room up stairs.
these two girls had beenboven hour place, happily employed
visitingn opposite milliner, watching sentinel on guard,nd
dressing saladnd cucumber.

after welcomingir sisters,y triumphantly displayed table set
out such cold meatsnn larder usuallyffords, exclaiming,
“is not nice? is notngreeable surprise?”

“we mean treat youll,”dded lydia, “but you must lend us
money, fwe have just spent ourst shop outre.”n, showing
her purchases--“look here, i have bought bonnet. i do not think
is very pretty; but i thought i mights well buys not. i shall
pull piecess soons i get home,nd see if i can make upny
better.”

when her sistersbuseds ugly, shedded, perfect
unconcern, “oh! butre were two three much uglier shop;nd
when i have bought some prettier-coloured sattrim fresh, i
think will be verylerable. besides, will not much signify what
one wears summer,fter ----shire have left meryton,ndy
are going fortnight.”

“areydeed!” cried elizabeth, greatest satisfaction.

“theyre going be encamped near brighton;nd i do so want papto
take usllre fsummer! would be such delicious scheme;
i dare say would hardly costnythingtll. mammwould like
gooll things! only think what miserable summer else we shall
have!”

“yes,” thought elizabeth, “_that_ would be delightful schemedeed,
completely do fust once. good heaven! brighton,nd whole
campful soldiers, us, who have been oversetlready by one poor
regiment militia,nd monthly balls meryton!”

“now i have got some news fyou,” said lydia,sy sat downt
table. “what do you think? is excellent news--capital news--andbout
certaperson well like!”

janend elizabeth lookedt each other,nd waiter wasld he need
not stay. lydilaughed,nd said:

“aye, that is just like your formalitynd discretion. you thought
waiter must not hear,s if he cared! i dare say heten hears worse
things said than im going say. but he isn ugly fellow! im glad
he is gone. i never saw such long chmy life. well, but now for
my news; isbout dear wickham;o good fwaiter, is not?
there is no danger wickham's marrying mary king.re's fyou! she
is gone down her unclet liverpool: gone stay. wickham is safe.”

“mary king is safe!”dded elizabeth; “safe from connection
imprudents fortune.”

“she is great fool fgoingway, if she liked him.”

“but i hopere is no strongttachment on either side,” said jane.

“im surere is not on _his_. i willnswer for, he never cared
three strawsbout her--who couldbout such nasty little freckled
thing?”

elizabeth was shocked think that, howevercapable such
coarseness _expression_ herself, coarseness _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harbourednd fancied liberal!

as soonsll hadte,nd elder ones paid, carriage was
ordered;ndfter some contrivance, whole party,llir
boxes, work-bags,nd parcels,nd unwelcomeddition kitty'snd
lydia's purchases, were seated.

“how nicely werell crammed,” cried lydia. “im glad i bought my
bonnet, if is only ffun havingnother bandbox! well, now
let us be quite comfortablend snug,nd talknd laughll way
home.nd first place, let us hear what has happened youll
since you wentway. have you seenny pleasant men? have you hadny
flirting? i was great hopes that one you would have got husband
before you came back. jane will be quiten old maid soon, i declare.
she islmost three-and-twenty! lord, howshamed i should be not
being married before three-and-twenty! myunt phillips wants you so
get husbands, you can't think. she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
collins; but _i_ do not thinkre would have beenny fun. lord!
how i should like be married beforeny you;ndn i would
chaperon youboutll balls. dear me! we had such good piece
fun other dayt colonel forster's. kittynd me were spend
dayre,nd mrs. forster promised have little dance
evening; (by bye, mrs. forsternd mere _such_ friends!)nd so
shesked two harringtons come, but harriet was ill,nd so pen
was forced come by herself;ndn, what do you think we did? we
dressed up chamberlayne woman's clothes on purpose pass for
lady, only think what fun! not soul knew, but colonelnd mrs.
forster,nd kittynd me, except myunt, fwe were forced borrow
one her gowns;nd you cannot imagine how well he looked! when denny,
wickham,nd pratt,nd two three more men came,y
did not know him least. lord! how i laughed!nd so did mrs.
forster. i thought i should have died.nd _that_ made men suspect
something,ndny soon found out what was matter.”

such kinds historiesir partiesnd good jokes, did
lydia,ssisted by kitty's hintsnddditions, endeavourmuse her
companionsll way longbourn. elizabeth listeneds littles she
could, butre was no escaping frequent mention wickham's name.

their receptiont home was most kind. mrs. bennet rejoiced see jane
undiminished beauty;nd more than once during dinner did mr. bennet
say voluntarily elizabeth:

“im glad youre come back, lizzy.”

their party dining-room was large, forlmostll lucases
came meet marihear news;nd various were subjects that
occupiedm: lady lucas wasquiring maria,fter welfarend
poultry her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hcollectingnccount present fashions from jane, who sat
some way below her,nd, on other, retailingmll younger
lucases;nd lydia, voice rather louder thanny other person's,
was enumerating various pleasures morningnybody who
would hear her.

“oh! mary,” said she, “i wish you had gone us, fwe had such fun!
as we wentlong, kittynd i drew up blinds,nd pretendedre
was nobody coach;nd i should have gone soll way, if kitty
had not been sick;nd when we got george, i do think we behaved
very handsomely, fwe treated other three nicest cold
luncheon world,nd if you would have gone, we would have treated
youo.ndn when we cameway was such fun! i thought we never
should have gotcoach. i was ready die laughter.ndn
we were so merryll way home! we talkednd laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten milesf!”

mary very gravely replied, “far be from me, my dear sister,
depreciate such pleasures!y would doubtless be congenial
generality female minds. but i confessy would have no charms for
_me_--i shouldfinitely prefer book.”

butnswer lydiheard not word. she seldom listened
anybody fmore than half minute,nd neverttended marytll.

infternoon lydiwas urgent rest girls walk
meryton,nd see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily
opposed scheme. should not be said that miss bennets could
not bet home half day beforey were pursuofficers.
there wasnother reasono fher opposition. she dreaded seeing mr.
wickhamgain,nd was resolvedvoids longs possible.
comfort _her_ regiment'spproaching removal wasdeed beyond
expression. fortnighty were go--once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more plague her on hisccount.

she had not been many hourst home before she found that brighton
scheme, which lydihad givenm hinttn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not smallesttention yielding; but hisnswers were
at same time so vaguend equivocal, that her mother, thoughten
disheartened, had never yet despaired succeedingt last.



chapter 40


elizabeth's impatiencecquaint jane what had happened could
no longer be overcome;ndt length, resolving suppress every
particular which her sister was concerned,nd preparing her be
surprised, she related her next morning chief scene
between mr. darcynd herself.

miss bennet'sstonishment was soon lessened by strong sisterly
partiality which madenydmiration elizabethppear perfectly
natural;ndll surprise was shortly lost other feelings. she was
sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments manner so
little suited recommendm; but still more was she grieved for
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

“his being so sure succeeding was wrong,” said she, “certainly
ought not haveppeared; but consider how much mustcrease his
disappointment!”

“indeed,” replied elizabeth, “im heartily sorry fhim; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon driveway his regard fme.
you do not blame me, however, frefusing him?”

“blame you! oh, no.”

“but you blame me fhaving spoken so warmly wickham?”

“no--i do not know that you were wrong saying what you did.”

“but you _will_ know, when i tell you what happened very next
day.”

shen spoke letter, repeating wholes contentss far
asy concerned george wickham. what stroke was fpojane!
who would willingly have gone through worldout believing that
so much wickedness existed whole race mankind,s was here
collected onedividual. nwas darcy's vindication, though
grateful her feelings, capable consoling her fsuch discovery.
most earnestly did she labour prove probability error,nd
seek clear oneoutvolving other.

“will not do,” said elizabeth; “you never will beble make both
ofm good fornything. take your choice, but you must be satisfied
only one.re is but such quantity merbetweenm; just
enough make one good sort man;nd late has been shifting
about pretty much. fmy part, imclined believell darcy's;
but you shall dos you choose.”

was some time, however, before smile could be extorted from jane.

“i do not know when i have been more shocked,” said she. “wickham so
very bad! islmost past belief.nd pomr. darcy! dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. such disappointment!nd
knowledge your ill opinion,o!nd having relate such thing
his sister! is reallyo distressing. im sure you must feel
so.”

“oh! no, my regretnd compassionrell doneway by seeing you so
full both. i know you will do him suchmple justice, that im
growing every moment more unconcernednddifferent. your profusion
makes me saving;nd if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
bes lights feather.”

“powickham!re is suchn expression goodness his
countenance! suchn opennessnd gentleness his manner!”

“there certainly was some great mismanagement education those
two young men. one has gotll goodness,nd otherll
appearance.”

“i never thought mr. darcy so deficient _appearance_s you
used do.”

“yet i meant be uncommonly clever taking so decided dislike
him,outny reason. is such spur one's genius, suchn
opening fwit, have dislike that kind. one may be continually
abusiveout sayingnything just; but one cannotlways be laughing
at manout nowndn stumbling on something witty.”

“lizzy, when you first read that letter, im sure you could not treat
matters you do now.”

“indeed, i could not. i was uncomfortable enough, i may say unhappy.nd
no one speakbout what i felt, no jane comfort mend say
that i had not been so very weaknd vainnd nonsensicals i knew i
had! oh! how i wanted you!”

“how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
speaking wickham mr. darcy, fnowy _do_ppear wholly
undeserved.”

“certainly. but misfortune speaking bitterness is most
natural consequence prejudices i had been encouraging.re
is one point on which i want yourdvice. i want beld whether i
ought, ought not, make ourcquaintances general understand
wickham's character.”

miss bennet paused little,ndn replied, “surelyre can be no
occasion fexposing him so dreadfully. what is your opinion?”

“that ought not bettempted. mr. darcy has notuthorised me
make his communication public. on contrary, every particular
relative his sister was meant be kepts muchs possible
myself;nd if i endeavour undeceive peoples rest his
conduct, who will believe me? general prejudicegainst mr. darcy
is so violent, that would be death half good people
merytonttempt place himnmiable light. im not equal
to. wickham will soon be gone;ndrefore will not signify
anyone here what he really is. some time hence will bell found out,
then we may laughtir stupidity not knowing before.t
present i will say nothingbout.”

“youre quite right. have his errors made public might ruhim for
ever. he is now, perhaps, sorry fwhat he has done,ndnxious
re-establish character. we must not make him desperate.”

tumult elizabeth's mind wasllayed by conversation. she had
got rid two secrets which had weighed on her ffortnight,
was certawilling listener jane, whenever she might wish
talkgaeither. butre was still something lurking behind,
which prudence forbade disclosure. she dared not relate other
half mr. darcy's letter, nexplaher sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. here was knowledge which no one
could partake;nd she was sensible that nothing less than perfect
understanding between parties could justify her throwingf
last encumbrance mystery. “then,” said she, “if that very
improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely beble
tell what bingley may tell much moregreeable manner himself.
liberty communication cannot be mine till has lostlls value!”

she was now, on being settledt home,t leisure observe real
state her sister's spirits. jane was not happy. she still cherished
very tenderffection fbingley. having never even fancied herself
love before, her regard hadll warmth firstttachment,
and, from hergend disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachmentsten boast;nd so fervently did she value his remembrance,
prefer him every other man, thatll her good sense,ndll her
attention feelings her friends, were requisite check
indulgence those regrets which must have beenjurious her own
healthndir tranquillity.

“well, lizzy,” said mrs. bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_
sad business jane's? fmy part, im determined never speak
ofgainnybody. ild my sister phillips so other day. but
i cannot find out that jane sawnything him london. well, he is
very undeserving young man--i do not supposere's least
chance world her ever getting him now.re is no talk
his coming netherfieldgasummer;nd i havequired
everybody,o, who is likely know.”

“i do not believe he will ever livet netherfieldny more.”

“oh well! is justs he chooses. nobody wants him come. though i
shalllways say he used my daughter extremely ill;nd if i was her, i
would not have put up. well, my comfort is, im sure jane will
die broken heart;ndn he will be sorry fwhat he has done.”

buts elizabeth could not receive comfort fromny such expectation,
she made nonswer.

“well, lizzy,” continued her mother, soonfterwards, “so
collinses live very comfortable, doy? well, well, i only hope
will last.nd what sort table doy keep? charlotte isn
excellent manager, i dare say. if she is halfs sharps her
mother, she is saving enough.re is nothing extravagant _their_
housekeeping, i dare say.”

“no, nothingtll.”

“great deal good management, depend upon. yes, yes, _they_ will
take care not outrunircome. _they_ will never be distressed
fmoney. well, much good may dom!nd so, i suppose,yten
talk having longbourn when your father is dead.y look upons
quiteir own, i dare say, whenever that happens.”

“was subject whichy could not mention before me.”

“no; would have been strange ify had; but i make no doubty
often talk betweenmselves. well, ify can be easyn
estate that is not lawfullyir own, so much better. i should be
ashamed having one that was only entailed on me.”

first weekir return was soon gone. second began. was

universal. elder miss bennetslone were stillble eat, drink,

lydia, whose own misery was extreme,nd who could not comprehend such
hard-heartednessny family.

“good heaven! what is become us? whatre we do?” wouldy
often exclaim bitterness woe. “how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?”

theirffectionate mother sharedllir grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

“im sure,” said she, “i cried ftwo daysgether when colonel
miller's regiment wentway. i thought i should have broken my heart.”

“im sure i shall break _mine_,” said lydia.

“if one could but go brighton!” observed mrs. bennet.

“oh, yes!--if one could but go brighton! but papis so
disagreeable.”

“little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”

on very last day regiment's remainingt meryton, he dined,

he looked surprised, displeased,larmed; but moment's

asked her how she had liked him. hernswer was warmly his favour.

“how long did you say he wast rosings?”

“nearly three weeks.”

“you saw him frequently?”

“yes,lmost every day.”

“his mannersre very different from his cousin's.”

“yes, very different. but i think mr. darcy improves uponcquaintance.”

“indeed!” cried mr. wickham look which did not escape her. “and

imprudence had brought on,ny those pleasures whichoten
console unfortunate forir follyir vice. he was fond
countrynd books;nd fromse tastes hadrisen his principal

her ignorancend folly had contributed hismusement. is not
sort happiness which man would general wish owe his
wife; but where other powers entertainmentre wanting, true
philosopher will derive beneffrom suchsre given.

elizabeth, however, had never been blind impropriety her
father's behaviours husband. she hadlways seen pain; but
respecting hisbilities,nd grateful fhisffectionate treatment
herself, she endeavoured forget what she could not overlook,nd
banish from her thoughts that continual breach conjugal obligation
decorum which, exposing his wife contempt her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. but she had never felt so

unsuitable marriage, never been so fullyware evilsrising
from so ill-judged direction talents; talents, which, rightly used,
mightt least have preserved respectability his daughters, even
ifcapable enlarging mind his wife.

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure she found little
other cause fsatisfaction loss regiment.ir parties
abroad were less varied than before,ndt home she had mothernd
sister whose constant repiningst dullness everythinground
them threw real gloom overir domestic circle;nd, though kitty
might time regaher natural degree sense, since disturbers
her brawere removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might bepprehended, was likely be hardenedll
her follyndssurance by situation such double dangers
watering-placend camp. upon whole,refore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, thatn event which she had been
looking impatient desire did not, taking place, bringll
satisfaction she had promised herself. was consequently necessary
name some other period fcommencementctual felicity--have
some other point on which her wishesnd hopes might be fixed,nd by
agaenjoying pleasurenticipation, console herself for
present,nd prepare fornother disappointment. herur lakes
was now object her happiest thoughts; was her best consolation
forll uncomfortable hours which discontentedness her mother
kitty madeevitable;nd could she havecluded jane
scheme, every part would have been perfect.

“but is fortunate,” thought she, “that i have something wish for.
were wholerrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
but here, by carrying me one ceaseless source regret my
sister'sbsence, i may reasonably hope havell my expectations
pleasure realised. scheme which every part promises delight can
never be successful;nd general disappointment is only wardedf by
defence some little peculiar vexation.”

when lydiwentway she promised write verytennd very minutely
her mothernd kitty; but her letters werelways long expected,nd
always very short. those her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from library, where suchnd suchficers

made her quite wild; that she had new gown, new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged leavef
violent hurry,s mrs. forster called her,ndy were goingf
camp;nd from her correspondence her sister,re was still
less be learnt--fher letters kitty, though rather longer, were
mucho full lines under words be made public.

must own that she was tired seeing great houses;fter going over so
many, she really had no pleasure fine carpets satcurtains.

splendour,nd more real elegance, than furniture rosings.

“place,” thought she, “i might have been mistress!

viewingms stranger, i might have rejoicedms my own,nd
welcomedms visitors my unclendunt. but no,”--recollecting
herself--“that could never be; my unclendunt would have been lost
me; i should not have beenllowedvitem.”

was lucky recollection--saved her from something very like
regret.

she longedquire housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not courage for.t length however, question
wassked by her uncle;nd she turnedwaylarm, while mrs.
reynolds replied that he was,dding, “but we expect him-morrow,

herunt now called her lookt picture. shepproachednd saw

up by himt his own expense. “he is now gonetormy,” shedded;
“but imfraid he has turned out very wild.”

mrs. gardiner lookedt her niece smile, but elizabeth could not
return.

“that,” said mrs. reynolds, pointingnother miniatures,
“is my master--very like him. was drawnt same times

“i have heard much your master's fine person,” said mrs. gardiner,

mrs. reynolds respect felizabeth seemedcrease on

“does that young lady know mr. darcy?”

elizabeth coloured,nd said: “little.”

“do not you think him very handsome gentleman, ma'am?”

“yes, very handsome.”

“im sure i know none so handsome; but gallery up stairs you

“oh! yes--handsomest young lady that ever was seen;nd so
accomplished!--she playsnd singsll day long. next room is
newstrument just come down fher--present from my master; she
comes here-morrow him.”

mr. gardiner, whose manners were very easynd pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questionsnd remarks; mrs. reynolds, either
by pridettachment, had evidently great pleasure talking her
masternd his sister.

“is your master mucht pemberley course year?”

“not so muchs i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his
time here;nd miss darcy islways down fsummer months.”

“except,” thought elizabeth, “when she goes ramsgate.”

“if your master would marry, you might see more him.”

“yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be. i do not know who is
good enough fhim.”

mr.nd mrs. gardiner smiled. elizabeth could not help saying, “is
very much his credit, im sure, that you should think so.”

“i say no more than truth,nd everybody will say that knows him,”
 replied other. elizabeth thought was going pretty far;nd she
listenedcreasingstonishments housekeeperdded, “i have
never known cross word from him my life,nd i have known him ever
since he was four years old.”

was praise,ll others most extraordinary, most opposite her
ideas. that he was not good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
her keenestttention waswakened; she longed hear more,nd was
grateful her uncle fsaying:

“therere very few people whom so much can be said. youre lucky
having such master.”

“yes, sir, i know im. if i were go through world, i could
not meet better. but i havelways observed, thaty whore

he waslways sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy

elizabethlmost staredt her. “can be mr. darcy?” thought she.

“his father wasn excellent man,” said mrs. gardiner.

“yes, ma'am, that he wasdeed;nd his son will be just like him--just
asffable poor.”

elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted,nd was impatient fmore. mrs.
reynolds couldterest her on no other point. she related subjects

furniture, vain. mr. gardiner, highlymused by kind family
prejudice which hettributed her excessive commendation her
master, soon ledgasubject;nd she dwelt energy on his
many meritssy proceededgether up great staircase.

“he is best landlord,nd best master,” said she, “that ever
lived; not like wild young men nowadays, who think nothing but
themselves.re is not one his tenants servants but will give
him good name. some people call him proud; but im sure i never saw
anything. my fancy, is only because he does not rattleway
like other young men.”

“whatnmiable light does place him!” thought elizabeth.

“fineccount him,” whispered heruntsy walked, “is not

“perhaps we might be deceived.”

“that is not very likely; ouruthority waso good.”

mrs. reynoldsnticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter

all that remained be shown. former were many good paintings;
but elizabeth knew nothingrt;nd from suchs had beenlready

also moretelligible.

lookedt her. she stood several minutes before picture, earnest
contemplation,nd returnedgabeforey quitted gallery.
mrs. reynoldsformedm that had been taken his father's
lifetime.

there was certainlyt moment, elizabeth's mind, more gentle
sensationwardsiginal than she had ever feltt height
theircquaintance. commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds
was no trifling nature. what praise is more valuable than praise
ofntelligent servant?s brother, landlord, master, she
considered how many people's happiness were his guardianship!--how
much pleasure pawas his power bestow!--how much
good evil must be done by him! every idethat had been brought
forward by housekeeper was favourable his character,nds she
stood before canvas on which he was represented,nd fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought his regard deeper sentiment
gratitude than had ever raised before; she remembereds warmth,nd
softeneds impropriety expression.

whenll house that was open generalspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs,nd, taking leave housekeeper, were
consigned over gardener, who metmt hall-door.

elizabeth heard not word,nd wholly engrossed by her own feelings,

had he spoken such gentlenesss on unexpected meeting. what
contrast didfer his lastddress rosings park, when he put

they had now entered beautiful walk by side water,nd
every step was bringing forward nobler fall ground, finer

what manner he thought her,nd whether, defiance everything,
she was still dear him. perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himselft ease; yetre had been _that_ his voice which was
not like ease. whether he had felt more papleasure
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her
composure.

at length, however, remarks her companions on herbsence mind
aroused her,nd she felt necessityppearing more like herself.

they entered woods,nd biddingdieu river fwhile,
ascended some higher grounds; when, spots where opening
trees gave eye power wander, were many charming views

but she had not got beyond words “delightful,”nd “charming,” when
some unlucky recollections obtruded,nd she fancied that praise
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. her colour changed,
she said no more.

mrs. gardiner was standing little behind;nd on her pausing, hesked
her if she would do him honourtroducing him her friends.

she could hardly suppress smilet his being now seeking
acquaintance some those very peoplegainst whom his pride had
revolted hisfer herself. “what will be his surprise,” thought
she, “when he knows whoyre? he takesm now fpeople
fashion.”

introduction, however, was immediately made;nds she namedir
relationship herself, she stole sly lookt him, see how he bore
it,nd was notout expectation his decampings fasts he
could from such disgraceful companions. that he was _surprised_ by
connection was evident; he sustained, however, fortitude,nd
so far from goingway, turned backm,nd enteredto
conversation mr. gardiner. elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. was consoling that he should know she had
some relations fwhomre was no need blush. she listened most
attentivelyll that passed betweenm,nd gloried every
expression, every sentence her uncle, which marked histelligence,
his taste, his good manners.

conversation soon turned upon fishing;nd she heard mr. darcy
invite him, greatest civility, fishrestens he
chose while he continued neighbourhood,feringt same time
supply him fishing tackle,nd pointing out those parts
stream wherere was usually most sport. mrs. gardiner, who was
walkingrm-in-arm elizabeth, gave her look expressive wonder.
elizabeth said nothing, but gratified her exceedingly; compliment
must bell fherself. herstonishment, however, was extreme,nd
continually was she repeating, “why is he soltered? from what can
proceed? cannot be f_me_--cannot be f_my_ sake that his
mannersre thus softened. my reproofst hunsford could not work such
changes. is impossible that he should still love me.”

after walking some time way, two ladies front, two
gentlemen behind, on resumingir places,fter descending
brink river fbetterspection some curious
water-plant,re chanced be littlelteration.iginated
mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by exercise morning, found
elizabeth'srmadequate her support,nd consequently preferred
her husband's. mr. darcyok her place by her niece,ndy walked on
together.fter short silence, lady first spoke. she wished him
know that she had beenssured hisbsence before she came
place,ndccordingly began by observing, that hisrrival had been
very unexpected--“fyour housekeeper,” shedded, “informed us that
you would certainly not be here till-morrow;nddeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
country.” hecknowledged truthll,nd said that
business his steward had occasioned his coming forward few hours
before rest party whom he had been travelling. “they
will jome early-morrow,” he continued, “andmongmre some
who will claimncquaintance you--mr. bingleynd his sisters.”

elizabethnswered only by slight bow. her thoughts werestantly
driven back time when mr. bingley's name had been last
mentioned betweenm;nd, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.

“there islso one other person party,” he continuedfter
pause, “who more particularly wishes be known you. will youllow
me, do isko much,troduce my sister yourcquaintance
during your stayt lambton?”

surprise suchnpplication was greatdeed; waso great
fher know what manner shecceded. she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have beingcquainted her
must be work her brother,nd,out looking farther, was
satisfactory; was gratifying know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill her.

they now walked on silence, eachm deep thought. elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flatterednd
pleased. his wishtroducing his sister her was compliment
highest kind.y soon outstripped others,nd wheny had
reached carriage, mr.nd mrs. gardiner were half quarter
mile behind.

hensked her walkhouse--but she declared herself not
tired,ndy stoodgether on lawn.t such time much might
have been said,nd silence was verywkward. she wanted talk, but
there seemed ben embargo on every subject.t last she recollected
that she had been travelling,ndy talked matlocknd dove dale

patiencend her ideas were nearly worn out before tete-a-tete was
over. on mr.nd mrs. gardiner's coming upy werell pressed go
inhousend take some refreshment; but was declined,nd
they parted on each side utmost politeness. mr. darcy handed
ladiescarriage;nd when drovef, elizabeth saw him
walking slowlywards house.

observations her unclendunt now began;nd eachm
pronounced him befinitely superitonythingy had expected.
“he is perfectly well behaved, polite,nd unassuming,” said her uncle.

“there _is_ something little stately him, be sure,” replied her
aunt, “but is confined hisir,nd is not unbecoming. i can now
say housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, i
have seen nothing.”

“i was never more surprised than by his behaviour us. was more
than civil; was reallyttentive;ndre was no necessity fsuch
attention. hiscquaintance elizabeth was very trifling.”

“be sure, lizzy,” said herunt, “he is not so handsomes wickham;
or, rather, he has not wickham's countenance, fhis features
are perfectly good. but how came you tell me that he was so
disagreeable?”

elizabeth excused herselfs wells she could; said that she had liked
him better wheny had met kent than before,nd that she had never
seen him so pleasants morning.

“but perhaps he may be little whimsical his civilities,” replied
her uncle. “your great mentenre;ndrefore i shall not take him
at his word,s he might change his mindnother day,nd warn mef
his grounds.”

elizabeth felt thaty had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.

“from what we have seen him,” continued mrs. gardiner, “i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved so cruel way by
anybodys he has done by powickham. he has notn ill-natured look.
on contrary,re is something pleasingbout his mouth when he
speaks.ndre is something dignity his countenance that would
not give onen unfavourable idehis heart. but, be sure,
good lady who showed us his house did give him most flaming character!
i could hardly help laughingloud sometimes. but he is liberal
master, i suppose,nd _that_ eye servant comprehends every
virtue.”

elizabeth here felt herself called on say something vindication
his behaviour wickham;ndrefore gavem understand,
as guarded manners she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations kent, hisctions were capable very different
construction;nd that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham's somiable,sy had been considered hertfordshire.

transactions whichy had been connected,outctually naming
heruthority, but stating be suchs might be relied on.

mrs. gardiner was surprisednd concerned; butsy were now

chapter 44


elizabeth had settled that mr. darcy would bring his sister visit
her very dayfter her reaching pemberley;nd was consequently
resolved not be out sightn whole that morning.
but her conclusion was false; fon very morningfterir
arrivalt lambton,se visitors came.y had been walkingbout
place someir new friends,nd were just returningn
dressmselves fdining same family, when sound
carriage drewm window,ndy saw gentlemannd lady

livery, guessed what meant,nd imparted no small degree her
surprise her relations bycquaintingm honour which she
expected. her unclendunt werellmazement;nd embarrassment
her manners she spoke, joined circumstanceself,nd many
circumstances preceding day, openedm new ideon
business. nothing had ever suggested before, buty felt that
there was no other wayccounting fsuchttentions from such
quarter than by supposing partiality forir niece. whilese
newly-born notions were passingir heads, perturbation
elizabeth's feelings wast every momentcreasing. she was quite
amazedt her own discomposure; butmongst other causes disquiet,
she dreaded lest partiality brother should have saido much
her favour;nd, more than commonlynxious please, she naturally
suspected that every power pleasing would fail her.

she retreated from window, fearful being seen;nds she walked
upnd down room, endeavouring compose herself, saw such looks
inquiring surprise her unclendunts made everything worse.

miss darcynd her brotherppeared,nd formidabletroduction
took place.stonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance wast leasts much embarrasseds herself. since her
beingt lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but observation very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. she found difficult obtaeven word from
her beyond monosyllable.

miss darcy was tall,nd on larger scale than elizabeth;nd, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed,nd herppearance
womanlynd graceful. she was less handsome than her brother; butre
was sensend good humour her face,nd her manners were perfectly
unassumingnd gentle. elizabeth, who had expected find hers
acutend unembarrassedn observers ever mr. darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

they had not long beengether before mr. darcyld her that bingley
waslso coming waon her;nd she had barely time express her
satisfaction,nd prepare fsuch visitor, when bingley's quick
step was heard on stairs,nd moment he entered room.ll
elizabeth'sngergainst him had been long doneway; but had she still
feltny, could hardly have stoods groundgainst unaffected
cordiality which he expressed himself on seeing hergain. he
inquired friendly, though general way,fter her family,nd looked
spoke same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

mr.nd mrs. gardiner he was scarcely lessteresting personage
than herself.y had long wished see him. whole party before
them,deed, excited livelyttention. suspicions which had just
arisen mr. darcyndir niece directedir observationwards
eachn earnest though guardedquiry;ndy soon drew from
thosequiries full conviction that onemt least knew
what was love. lady's sensationsy remained little
doubt; but that gentleman was overflowingdmiration was
evident enough.

elizabeth, on her side, had much do. she wantedscertain
feelings each her visitors; she wanted compose her own,nd
make herselfgreeablell;nd latter object, where she
feared most fail, she was most sure success, fthose whom she
endeavoured give pleasure were prepossessed her favour. bingley
was ready, georgianwas eager,nd darcy determined, be pleased.

seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew her sister;nd, oh!
howrdently did she long know whetherny his were directed
like manner. sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions,nd once twice pleased herself notion
that,s he lookedt her, he was trying trace resemblance. but,
though might be imaginary, she could not be deceiveds his
behaviour miss darcy, who had been set ups rival jane. no look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. nothing occurred
betweenm that could justify hopes his sister. on point
she was soon satisfied;nd two three little circumstances occurred
erey parted, which, hernxiousterpretation, denoted
recollection jane not untinctured by tenderness,nd wish saying
more that might lead mention her, had he dared. he observed
her,t moment when others were talkinggether,ndne
which had something real regret, that “was very long time since
he had had pleasure seeing her;”nd, before she could reply,
hedded, “isbove eight months. we have not met since 26th
november, when we werell dancinggethert netherfield.”

elizabeth was pleased find his memory so exact;nd hefterwards
took occasionsk her, when unattended byny rest, whether
_all_ her sisters weret longbourn.re was not much question,
npreceding remark; butre was looknd manner which
gavem meaning.

was notten that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself;
but, whenever she did catch glimpse, she sawn expression general
complaisance,ndll that he said she heardnccent so removed
from _hauteur_ disdahis companions,s convinced her that
improvement manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporarys existence might prove, hadt least outlived one day. when
she saw him thus seekingcquaintancend courting good opinion
people whomnytercourse few monthsgo would have been
disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only herself, but
very relations whom he had openly disdained,nd recollectedir last
lively scene hunsford parsonage--difference, change was
so great,nd struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restraherstonishment from being visible. never, even company
his dear friendst netherfield, his dignified relations
at rosings, had she seen him so desirous please, so free from
self-consequence unbending reserve,s now, when no importance
could result from success his endeavours,nd when even
acquaintance those whom histtentions wereddressed would draw
down ridiculend censure ladies both netherfieldnd
rosings.

their visitors stayedmbove half-an-hour;nd whenyrose
depart, mr. darcy called on his sister johim expressing
their wish seeing mr.nd mrs. gardiner,nd miss bennet, dinner
at pemberley, beforey left country. miss darcy, though
diffidence which marked her little habgivingvitations,
readily obeyed. mrs. gardiner lookedt her niece, desirous knowing
how _she_, whomvitation most concerned, felt disposedss
acceptance, but elizabeth had turnedway her head. presuming however,
that studiedvoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment than
any dislike proposal,nd seeing her husband, who was fond
society, perfect willingnessccept, she ventured engage for
herttendance,nd dayfter next was fixed on.

bingley expressed great pleasure certainty seeing elizabeth
again, having still great deal say her,nd manyquiries
makefterllir hertfordshire friends. elizabeth, construingll
inwish hearing her speak her sister, was pleased,nd on
thisccount,s wells some others, found herself, whenir

notir wish force her communication. was evident that she was
much bettercquainted mr. darcy thany had beforeny ideof;
was evident that he was very much love her.y saw much

son his patron were imperfectly understood, was yet well-known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind

as felizabeth, her thoughts weret pemberley evening more than

she laywake two whole hours endeavouring makem out. she
certainly did not hate him. no; hatred had vanished longgo,nd she

chapter 45


convinceds elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike her had
originated jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearancet pemberley must be her,nd was curious know how
much civility on that lady's sidecquaintance would now be renewed.

on reaching house,y were shown through hallsaloon,
whose northernspect rendered delightful fsummer.s windows

which were scattered overtermediate lawn.

all embarrassment which, though proceeding from shynessnd fear
doing wrong, would easily give those who feltmselvesferior
belief her being proudnd reserved. mrs. gardinernd her niece,
however, did her justice,nd pitied her.

by mrs. hurstnd miss bingleyy were noticed only by curtsey;nd,
onir being seated, pause,wkwards such pauses mustlways be,
succeeded ffew moments. was first broken by mrs.nnesley,
genteel,greeable-looking woman, whose endeavourtroduce some kind
discourse proved her be more truly well-bred than either
others;nd between hernd mrs. gardiner, occasional help from
elizabeth, conversation was carried on. miss darcy lookeds if she
wished fcourage enough join;nd sometimes did venture
short sentence whenre was least dangers being heard.

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
that she could not speak word, especially miss darcy,out
calling herttention. observation would not have prevented her
from trying talk latter, hady not been seatedtn
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry be spared necessity
saying much. her own thoughts were employing her. she expected every
moment that some gentlemen would enter room. she wished, she
feared that master house might bemongstm;nd whether
she wished feared most, she could scarcely determine.fter
sitting manner quartern hourout hearing miss
bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her cold
inquiryfter health her family. shenswered equal
indifferencend brevity,nd other said no more.

entrance servants cold meat, cake,nd varietyll

party--fthoughy could notll talk,y couldll eat;nd
beautiful pyramids grapes, nectarines,nd peaches soon collected
them round table.

while thus engaged, elizabeth had fair opportunity deciding whether
she most feared wished forppearance mr. darcy, by
feelings which prevailed on his entering room;ndn, though but
moment before she had believed her wishes predominate, she began
regret that he came.

he had been some time mr. gardiner, who, two three other
gentlemen from house, was engaged by river,nd had left him
only on learning that ladies familytended visto
georgianthat morning. no sooner did heppear than elizabeth wisely
resolved be perfectly easynd unembarrassed; resolution more
necessary be made, but perhaps not more easily kept, because she
saw that suspicions whole party werewakenedgainstm,
thatre was scarcelyn eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first cameroom. no countenance wasttentive
curiosity so strongly markeds miss bingley's, spite
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke ones
objects; fjealousy had not yet made her desperate,nd herttentions
mr. darcy were by no means over. miss darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more talk,nd elizabeth saw that he
wasnxious fhis sisternd herself getcquainted,nd forwarded
as muchs possible, everyttemptt conversation on either side. miss
bingley sawll likewise;nd, imprudencenger,ok
first opportunity saying, sneering civility:

“pray, miss eliza,re not ----shire militiremoved from meryton?
they must be great loss _your_ family.”

darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost her thoughts;nd
various recollections connected him gave her moment's distress;
but exerting herself vigorously repel ill-naturedttack, she
presentlynswered questionlerably detachedne. while
she spoke,nvoluntary glance showed her darcy, heightened
complexion, earnestly lookingt her,nd his sister overcome
confusion,nd unable lift up her eyes. had miss bingley known what
pashe wasn giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from hint; but she had merelytended discompose
elizabeth by bringing forward ideman whom she believed
her partial, make her betray sensibility which mightjure her
darcy's opinion,nd, perhaps, remind latterll follies
andbsurdities by which some part her family were connected
that corps. not syllable had ever reached her miss darcy's
meditated elopement. no creature had been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except elizabeth;nd fromll bingley's connections
her brother was particularlynxious conceal, from very
wish which elizabeth had longgottributed him,ir becoming
hereafter her own. he had certainly formed such plan,ndout
meaning that shouldffect his endeavour separate him from miss
bennet, is probable that mightdd something his lively concern
fwelfare his friend.

elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion;nd
as miss bingley, vexednd disappointed, dared notpproach nearer
wickham, georgianalso recovered time, though not enough beble
speakny more. her brother, whose eye she feared meet, scarcely
recollected herterestffair,nd very circumstance which
had been designed turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed have
fixedm on her morend more cheerfully.

bingley was venting her feelings criticisms on elizabeth's person,
behaviour,nd dress. but georgianwould not joher. her brother's
recommendation was enough ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err.nd he had spoken such terms elizabeths leave georgiana
without power finding her otherwise than lovelyndmiable. when
darcy returned saloon, miss bingley could not help repeating
him some part what she had been saying his sister.

“how very ill miss elizbennet looks morning, mr. darcy,” she
cried; “i never my life sawnyone so muchltereds she is since
winter. she is grown so brownnd coarse! louisi weregreeing
that we should not have known hergain.”

however little mr. darcy might have liked suchnddress, he contented
himself coolly replying that he perceived no otherlteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence travelling
summer.

“fmy own part,” she rejoined, “i must confess that i never could
seeny beauty her. her face iso thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy;nd her featuresre nottll handsome. her nose
wants character--there is nothing markeds lines. her teethre
tolerable, but not out common way;nds fher eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, i could never seenything
extraordinarym.y have sharp, shrewish look, which i do
not liketll;nd herirltogetherre is self-sufficiency
without fashion, which istolerable.”

persuadeds miss bingley was that darcydmired elizabeth, was not
best method recommending herself; butngry peoplere notlways
wise;nd seeing himt last look somewhat nettled, she hadll
success she expected. he was resolutely silent, however,nd, from
determination making him speak, she continued:

“i remember, when we first knew her hertfordshire, howmazed well
were find that she was reputed beauty;nd i particularly recollect
your saying one night,ftery had been diningt netherfield, '_she_
beauty!--i shoulds soon call her mother wit.' butfterwards she
seemed improve on you,nd i believe you thought her rather prettyt
one time.”

“yes,” replied darcy, who could contahimself no longer, “but _that_
was only when i first saw her, fis many months since i have
considered hers one handsomest women mycquaintance.”

hen wentway,nd miss bingley was leftll satisfaction
having forced him say what gave no oneny pabut herself.

visit,sy returned, except what had particularlyterestedm
both. looknd behaviour everybodyy had seen were discussed,
except person who had mostly engagedirttention.y talked
his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--everything but

elizabeth had been good deal disappointed not finding letter from
jane onir firstrrivalt lambton;nd disappointment had been
renewed on each mornings that had now been spentre; but
on third her repining was over,nd her sister justified, by
receipt two letters from hert once, on one which was marked that
had been missent elsewhere. elizabeth was not surprisedt,s
jane had written direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing walks letters came;nd

“since writingbove, dearest lizzy, something has occurred

assured that werell well. what i have say relates polydia.

withoutllowing herself time fconsideration,nd scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth on finishing letterstantly seized
other,nd opening utmost impatience, reads follows:
had been written day later than conclusion first.

“by time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i
wish may be moretelligible, but though not confined ftime, my

withoutny success--no such people had been seen pass through.

their first plan;nd even if _he_ could form such designgainst
young woman lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose
her so lost everything? impossible! i grieve find, however, that
colonel f. is not disposed depend uponir marriage; he shook his
head when i expressed my hopes,nd said he feared w. was not man
be trusted. my pomother is really ill,nd keeps her room. could she
exert herself, would be better; but is not be expected.nd
as my father, i never my life saw him soffected. pokitty has

have been spared somethingse distressing scenes; but now,s
first shock is over, shall i own that i long fyour return? im not

take up my pengado what i have justld you i would not; but
circumstancesre such that i cannot help earnestly begging youll

that im notfraid requesting, though i have still something
moresk former. my father is going london colonel
forsterstantly, try discover her. what he means do im sure
i know not; but his excessive distress will notllow him pursueny
measure bestnd safest way,nd colonel forster is obliged
bet brightongain-morrow evening. suchn exigence, my
uncle'sdvicendssistance would be everything world; he will
immediately comprehend what i must feel,nd i rely upon his goodness.”

“oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished letter, eagerness follow him,out losing
moment time so precious; buts she reached dowas
opened by servant,nd mr. darcyppeared. her pale facend impetuous
manner made him start,nd before he could recover himself speak,
she, whose mind every idewas superseded by lydia's situation,
hastily exclaimed, “i beg your pardon, but i must leave you. i must find
mr. gardiner moment, on business that cannot be delayed; i have not
anstant lose.”

“good god! what is matter?” cried he, more feeling than
politeness;n recollecting himself, “i will not detayou minute;
but let me, let servant gofter mr.nd mrs. gardiner. youre
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”

elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under hernd she felt how
little would be gained by herttempting pursuem. calling back
servant,refore, she commissioned him, though so breathless
anccents made herlmost unintelligible, fetch his masternd
mistress homestantly.

on his quitting room she sat down, unable support herself,nd
looking so miserably ill, that was impossible fdarcy leave her,
refrafrom saying,ne gentlenessnd commiseration,
“let me call your maid. isre nothing you could take give you
present relief? glass wine; shall i get you one? youre very ill.”

“no, i thank you,” she replied, endeavouring recover herself. “there
is nothing matter me. im quite well; im only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn.”

she bursttearss shelluded,nd ffew minutes could
not speaknother word. darcy, wretched suspense, could only say
somethingdistinctly his concern,nd observe her compassionate
silence.t length she spokegain. “i have just had letter from jane,
such dreadful news. cannot be concealed fromnyone. my younger
sister has leftll her friends--has eloped; has thrown herselfto
power--mr. wickham.yre gonefgether from brighton.
_you_ know himo well doubt rest. she has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him--she is lost fever.”

darcy was fixedstonishment. “when i consider,” shedded yet
moregitated voice, “that i might have prevented! i, who knew what
he was. had i but explained some part only--some part what i
learnt, my own family! had his character been known, could not
have happened. but isll--allo late now.”

“im grieveddeed,” cried darcy; “grieved--shocked. but is
certain--absolutely certain?”

“oh, yes!y left brightongether on sunday night,nd were traced
almost london, but not beyond;yre certainly not gone
scotland.”

“what has been done, what has beenttempted, recover her?”

“my father is gone london,nd jane has written beg my uncle's
immediatessistance;nd we shall bef, i hope, half-an-hour. but
nothing can be done--i know very well that nothing can be done. how is
such man be worked on? howrey even be discovered? i have
not smallest hope. is every way horrible!”

darcy shook his head silentcquiescence.

“when _my_ eyes were opened his real character--oh! had i known what
i ought, what i dared do! but i knew not--i wasfraid doingo
much. wretched, wretched mistake!”

darcy made nonswer. he seemed scarcely hear her,nd was walking
upnd down room earnest meditation, his brow contracted, hisir
gloomy. elizabeth soon observed,ndstantly understood. her
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such profamily
weakness, suchnssurance deepest disgrace. she could neither
wonder ncondemn, but belief his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory her bosom,fforded no palliation her distress.
was, on contrary, exactly calculated make her understher own
wishes;nd never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him,s now, whenll love must be vain.

but self, though wouldtrude, could not engross her. lydia--the
humiliation, misery she was bringing onmll, soon swallowed
up every private care;nd covering her face her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost everything else;nd,fter pause
several minutes, was only recalled sense her situation by
voice her companion, who, manner which, though spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “imfraid you have been
long desiring mybsence, nhaveything plead excuse my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. would heaven thatnything
could be either said done on my part that mightfer consolation
such distress! but i will notrment you vawishes, which may
seem purposelysk fyour thanks. unfortunateffair will, i
fear, prevent my sister's having pleasure seeing yout pemberley
to-day.”

“oh, yes. be so kindspologise fus miss darcy. say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal unhappy truths
longs is possible, i know cannot be long.”

he readilyssured her his secrecy;gaexpressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished happier conclusion thanre wast present
reason hope,nd leaving his compliments fher relations, only
one serious, parting look, wentway.

as he quitted room, elizabeth felt how improbable was thaty
should ever see each othergaon such terms cordialitys
had markedir several meetings derbyshire;nds she threw
retrospective glance over wholeircquaintance, so full
contradictionsnd varieties, sighedt perverseness those
feelings which would now have promoteds continuance,nd would
formerly have rejoiceds termination.

if gratitudend esteemre good foundationsffection, elizabeth's
change sentiment will be neither improbable nfaulty. but if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable
unnatural, comparison what is soten describedsrising on
firstterviews object,nd even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said her defence, except that she had given
somewhat trial latter method her partiality fwickham,
thats ill success might, perhaps,uthorise her seek other
lessteresting modettachment. be thats may, she saw him
go regret;nd early example what lydia'sfamy must
produce, founddditionalnguishs she reflected on that wretched
business. never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained
hope wickham's meaning marry her. no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself suchn expectation. surprise was least
her feelings on development. while contents first
letter remained her mind, she wasll surprise--allstonishment that
wickham should marry girl whom was impossible he could marry
fmoney;nd how lydicould ever havettached him hadppeared
incomprehensible. but now wasllo natural. fsuchnttachment
as she might have sufficient charms;nd though she did not suppose
lydibe deliberately engagingn elopementouttention

nher understanding would preserve her from fallingn easy prey.

she had never perceived, while regiment was hertfordshire, that

wanted only encouragementttach herselfnybody. sometimes one
officer, sometimesnother, had been her favourite,sirttentions

she was wild bet home--hear, see, be upon spot

family so deranged, fatherbsent, mothercapable exertion,nd
requiring constantttendance;nd thoughlmost persuaded that nothing
could be done flydia, her uncle'sterference seemed utmost
importance,nd till he entered room her impatience was severe. mr.
mrs. gardiner had hurried backlarm, supposing by servant's
account thatir niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfyingm
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated causeir
summons, reading two lettersloud,nd dwelling on postscript

afflicted. not lydionly, butll were concerned;ndfter

assistance his power. elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him tears gratitude;ndll three beingctuated by one spirit,

 cried mrs. gardiner. “johnld us mr. darcy was here when you sent for

“yes;nd ild him we should not beble keep our engagement.
_that_ isll settled.”

“what isll settled?” repeated other,s she ranher room

chapter 47


“i have been thinking overgain, elizabeth,” said her uncle,sy
drove fromwn; “really, upon serious consideration, im much
moreclined than i was judges your eldest sister does on
matter.ppears me so very unlikely thatny young man should
form such designgainst girl who is by no means unprotected
friendless,nd who wasctually staying his colonel's family, that i
am stronglyclined hope best. could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? could he expect be noticedgaby
regiment,fter suchnffront colonel forster? his temptation is
notdequate risk!”

“do you really think so?” cried elizabeth, brightening up fmoment.

“upon my word,” said mrs. gardiner, “i begbe your uncle's
opinion. is reallyo great violation decency, honour,nd
interest, fhim be guilty. i cannot think so very ill
wickham. can you yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up,s believe
him capable?”

“not, perhaps, neglecting his ownterest; but every other
neglect i can believe him capable. if,deed, should be so! but i
dare not hope. why shouldy not go on scotlif that had been
case?”

“first place,” replied mr. gardiner, “there is nobsolute proof
thatyre not gone scotland.”

“oh! butir removing from chaisehackney coach is such
presumption!nd, besides, no tracesm were be found on
barnet road.”

“well,n--supposingm be london.y may bere, though
fpurpose concealment, fno more exceptional purpose. is
not likely that money should be verybundant on either side;nd
might strikem thaty could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married london than scotland.”

“but whyll secrecy? whyny fear detection? why mustir
marriage be private? oh, no, no--is not likely. his most particular
friend, you see by jane'sccount, was persuaded his nevertending
marry her. wickham will never marry womanout some money. he
cannotfford.nd what claims has lydia--whatttraction has she
beyond youth, health,nd good humour that could make him, fher sake,
forego every chance benefiting himself by marrying well?s what
restraintpprehensions disgrace corps might throw on
dishonourable elopement her, im notble judge; fi know
nothing effects that such step might produce. buts your
other objection, imfraid will hardly hold good. lydihas
no brothers step forward;nd he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from hisdolencend littlettention he has ever
seemed give what was going forward his family, that _he_ would
dos little,nd thinks littlebout,sny father could do,
such matter.”

“but can you think that lydiis so lost everything but love him
as consent live him onny terms other than marriage?”

“does seem,nd is most shockingdeed,” replied elizabeth,
tears her eyes, “that sister's sense decencynd virtue such
point shoulddmdoubt. but, really, i know not what say.
perhaps im not doing her justice. but she is very young; she has never
been taught think on serious subjects;nd flast half-year,
nay, ftwelvemonth--she has been given up nothing butmusement
vanity. she has beenllowed dispose her time most idle
frivolous manner,nddoptny opinions that came her way.
since ----shire were first quartered meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation,ndficers have been her head. she has been doing
everything her power by thinkingnd talking on subject, give
greater--what shall i call? susceptibility her feelings; whichre
naturally lively enough.nd well know that wickham has every charm
personndddress that can captivate woman.”

“but you see that jane,” said herunt, “does not think so very ill
wickhams believe him capablettempt.”

“whom does jane ever think ill?nd who isre, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable suchnttempt,
till were provedgainstm? but jane knows,s wells i do, what
wickham really is. we both know that he has been profligate every
sense word; that he has neithertegrity nhonour; that he is
as falsend deceitfuls he issinuating.”

“do you really knowll?” cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
as mode hertelligence waslllive.

“i dodeed,” replied elizabeth, colouring. “ild you, other day,
hisfamous behaviour mr. darcy;nd you yourself, when lastt
longbourn, heard what manner he spoke man who had behaved
such forbearancend liberalitywards him.ndrere other
circumstances which im nott liberty--which is not worth while
relate; but his liesbout whole pemberley familyre endless. from
what he said miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared see proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. yet he knew contrary himself. he
must know that she wassmiablend unpretendings we have found
her.”

“but does lydiknow nothing? can she be ignorant what you
jane seem so well understand?”

“oh, yes!--that, that is worstll. till i was kent,nd saw
so much both mr. darcynd his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant truth myself.nd when i returned home, ----shire
was leave meryton week fortnight's time.s that was
case, neither jane, whom i related whole, ni, thought
necessary make our knowledge public; fwhat use could
itpparently beny one, that good opinion whichll
neighbourhood had him shouldn be overthrown?nd even when was
settled that lydishould go mrs. forster, necessity opening
her eyes his character never occurred me. that _she_ could be
inny danger from deception never entered my head. that such
consequences _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts.”

“whenyll removed brighton,refore, you had no reason, i
suppose, believem fond each other?”

“not slightest. i can remember no symptomffection on either
side;nd hadnything kind been perceptible, you must beware
that ours is not family on which could be thrownway. when first
he entered corps, she was ready enoughdmire him; but so well
were. every girl near meryton was out her sensesbout him for
first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ byny particular
attention;nd, consequently,fter moderate period extravagantnd

its repeated discussion, no other could detainm from long, during

fixedre by keenestllnguish, self-reproach, she could find
noterval ease forgetfulness.

they travelleds expeditiouslys possible,nd, sleeping one night
on road, reached longbourn by dinner time next day. was
comfort elizabeth consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

on steps housesy entered paddock;nd, when

faces,nd displayedself overir whole bodies, variety

elizabeth jumped out;nd,fter giving eachm hasty kiss,

mother'spartment, immediately met her.

elizabeth,s sheffectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled
eyes both, lost not momentsking whethernything had been

“not yet,” replied jane. “but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
everything will be well.”

“is my fatherwn?”

“yes, he went on tuesday,s i wrote you word.”

“have you heard from himten?”

“we have heard only twice. he wrote me few lines on wednesday say
that he hadrrived safety,nd give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him do. he merelydded that he should not write
agatill he had something importance mention.”

“my mother--how is she? howre youll?”

“my mother islerably well, i trust; though her spiritsre greatly
shaken. she is up stairsnd will have great satisfaction seeing you
all. she does not yet leave her dressing-room. marynd kitty, thank
heaven,re quite well.”

“but you--howre you?” cried elizabeth. “you look pale. how much you
must have gone through!”

her sister, however,ssured her her being perfectly well;ndir
conversation, which had been passing while mr.nd mrs. gardiner were
engagedir children, was now putn end bypproach

thankedm both,lternate smilesnd tears.

wheny werell drawing-room, questions which elizabeth
hadlreadysked were course repeated by others,ndy soon
found that jane had notelligence give. sanguine hope
good, however, which benevolence her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that wouldll end well,nd that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydiher father,
explainir proceedings,nd, perhaps,nnounceir marriage.

blaming everybody but person whose ill-judgingdulgence

“if i had beenble,” said she, “carry my point going brighton,
withll my family, _this_ would not have happened; but podear lydia
had nobody take care her. why did forsters ever let her go out

though her brothernd sister were persuaded thatre was no real
occasion fsuch seclusion from family,y did notttempt
oppose, fory knew that she had not prudence enough hold her
tongue before servants, whiley waitedt table,nd judged
better that _one_ only household,nd one whomy could
most trust should comprehendll her fearsnd solicitude on
subject.

dining-roomy were soon joined by marynd kitty, who had been
too busily engagedir separatepartments makeirppearance
before. one came from her books,nd other from herilette.
faces both, however, werelerably calm;nd no change was visible
either, except that loss her favourite sister,nger
which she had herselfcurred business, had given more
fretfulness than usualccents kitty.s fmary, she was
mistress enough herself whisper elizabeth, countenance
grave reflection, soonftery were seatedt table:

“is most unfortunateffair,nd will probably be much talked.
but we must stem tide malice,nd pourwounded bosoms
each other balm sisterly consolation.”

then, perceiving elizabeth noclination replying, shedded,
“unhappys event must be flydia, we may draw from useful
lesson: that loss virtue female is irretrievable; that one
false stepvolves her endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than is beautiful;nd that she cannot beo much guarded
her behaviourwards undeserving other sex.”

elizabeth lifted up her eyesmazement, but waso much oppressed
makeny reply. mary, however, continued console herself such
kind moral extractions from evil beforem.

infternoon, two elder miss bennets wereble be for
half-an-hour bymselves;nd elizabethstantlyvailed herself
opportunity makingnyquiries, which jane was equally eager
satisfy.fter joining general lamentations over dreadful sequel
event, which elizabeth consideredsll but certain,nd miss
bennet could notssert be wholly impossible, former continued
subject, by saying, “but tell mellnd everythingbout which
i have notlready heard. give me further particulars. what did colonel
forster say? hady nopprehensionnything before elopement
took place?y must have seenmgether fever.”

“colonel forster did own that he hadten suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia's side, but nothing give himnylarm. im so
grieved fhim! his behaviour wasttentivend kind utmost. he
_was_ coming us,derssure us his concern, before he had
any ideofir not being gone scotland: when thatpprehension
first gotbroad, hastened his journey.”

“was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know
theirtending gof? had colonel forster seen denny himself?”

“yes; but, when questioned by _him_, denny denied knowingnything
their plans,nd would not give his real opinionbout. he did not
repeat his persuasionir not marrying--from _that_, im
inclined hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”

“till colonel forster came himself, not one you entertained
doubt, i suppose,ir being really married?”

“how was possible that suchn ideshould enter our brains? i felt
little uneasy--little fearful my sister's happiness him
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not beenlways quite
right. my fathernd mother knew nothing that;y only felt how
imprudent match must be. kittyn owned, very natural
triumph on knowing more than rest us, that lydia's last letter
she had prepared her fsuch step. she had known, seems,ir
being love each other, many weeks.”

“but not beforey went brighton?”

“no, i believe not.”

“did colonel forsterppear think well wickham himself? does
he know his real character?”

“i must confess that he did not speak so well wickhams he formerly
did. he believed him be imprudentnd extravagant.nd since sad
affair has taken place, is said that he left meryton greatly debt;
but i hope may be false.”

“oh, jane, had we been less secret, had weld what we knew him,
could not have happened!”

“perhaps would have been better,” replied her sister. “but expose
former faultsny personout knowing whatir present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. wected besttentions.”

“could colonel forster repeat particulars lydia's note his
wife?”

“he brought him fus see.”

“oh! jane,” cried elizabeth, “wasre servant belonging who

“i do not know. i hopere was. but be guardedt such time is

whole party were hopes letter from mr. bennet next
morning, but post cameout bringing single line from him.
his family knew him be, onll common occasions, most negligentnd
dilatory correspondent; butt such timey had hoped fexertion.
they were forced conclude that he had no pleasingtelligence

gardiner had waited only fletters before he setf.

security fher husband's not being killed duel.

mrs. gardinernd children were remahertfordshire few

she seldom wentwayout leavingm more dispirited than she found

all meryton seemed striving blacken man who, but three months
before, had beenlmostnngel light. he was declared be debt
every tradesman place,nd histrigues,ll honoured
title seduction, had been extendedevery tradesman's family.
everybody declared that he was wickedest young man world;
everybody began find out thaty hadlways distrusted
appearance his goodness. elizabeth, though she did not creditbove
half what was said, believed enough make her formerssurance
her sister's rumore certain;nd even jane, who believed still less
of, becamelmost hopeless, more especiallys time was now come
when, ify had gone scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired,y mustll probability have gained some news
them.

mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday his wife received
letter from him;ldm that, on hisrrival, he had immediately
found out his brother,nd persuaded him come gracechurch street;
that mr. bennet had been epsomnd clapham, before hisrrival,
butout gainingny satisfactoryformation;nd that he was now

thought possibley might have gone onem, onir first

did not expectny success from measure, buts his brother was
eager, he meantssist him pursuing. hedded that mr.
bennet seemed wholly disinclinedt present leave londonnd promised
writegavery soon.re waslso postscript effect:

“i have written colonel forster desire him find out, if
possible, from some young man'stimates regiment,
whether wickham hasny relations connections who would be likely

anyone that one couldpply probability gaining such
clues that, might be essential consequence.t present we have
nothing guide us. colonel forster will, i dare say, do everything
his power satisfy us on head. but, on second thoughts, perhaps,
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better thanny
other person.”

elizabeth wast no loss understfrom whence deference her
authority proceeded; but was not her power givenyformation
so satisfactory natures compliment deserved. she had never
heard his having hadny relations, except fathernd mother, both
whom had been dead many years. was possible, however, that some
his companions ----shire might beble give moreformation;
though she was not very sanguine expecting,pplication
was something look forward.

every dayt longbourn was now daynxiety; but mostnxious
part each was when post was expected.rrival letters
was grobject every morning's impatience. through letters,
whatever good bad was beld would be communicated,nd every
succeeding day was expected bring some news importance.

but beforey heardgafrom mr. gardiner, letterrrived for
their father, from different quarter, from mr. collins; which,s jane
had received directions openll that came fhim hisbsence,
sheccordingly read;nd elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letterslways were, looked over her,nd read likewise. wass
follows:

“my dear sir,

“i feel myself called upon, by our relationship,nd my situation

“im, dear sir, etc., etc.”

mr. gardiner did not writegatill he had receivednnswer from
colonel forster;ndn he had nothing pleasant nature send.
was not known that wickham had single relationship whom he
kept upny connection,nd was certathat he had no near one
living. his formercquaintances had been numerous; but since he
had been militia, did notppear that he was on terms
particular friendshipnym.re was no one,refore,
who could be pointed outs likely giveny news him.nd
wretched state his own finances,re was very powerful motive for
secrecy,ddition his fear discovery by lydia's relations, for
had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him
very considerablemount. colonel forster believed that more than
thouspounds would be necessary clear his expensest brighton.
he owed good dealwn, but his debts honour were still more
formidable. mr. gardiner did notttempt concealse particulars
from longbourn family. jane heardm horror. “gamester!”
 she cried. “is wholly unexpected. i had notn ideof.”

mr. gardinerdded his letter, thaty might expect seeir
fathert home on following day, which was saturday. rendered
spiritless by ill-successllir endeavours, he had yielded
his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return his family,nd
leave him do whatever occasion might suggest bedvisable
fcontinuingir pursuit. when mrs. bennet wasld, she did
not express so much satisfactions her children expected, considering
what hernxiety fhis life had been before.

“what, is he coming home,ndout polydia?” she cried. “sure he
will not leave london before he has foundm. who is fight wickham,
make him marry her, if he comesway?”

as mrs. gardiner began wish bet home, was settled that she
children should go london,t same time that mr. bennet
came from. coach,refore,okm first stageir
journey,nd broughts master back longbourn.

mrs. gardiner wentwayll perplexitybout elizabethnd her
derbyshire friend that hadttended her from that part world. his
name had never been voluntarily mentioned beforem by her niece;nd
kind half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed,ir
being followed by letter from him, had ended nothing. elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from pemberley.

present unhappy state family renderedny other excuse for
lowness her spirits unnecessary; nothing,refore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by time
tolerably wellcquainted her own feelings, was perfectlyware
that, had she known nothing darcy, she could have borne dread
lydia'sfamy somewhat better. would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out two.

when mr. bennetrrived, he hadllppearance his usual
philosophic composure. he saids littles he had ever been
habsaying; made no mention business that had taken him
away,nd was some time before his daughters had courage speak
it.

was not tillfternoon, when he had joinedmt tea, that
elizabeth venturedtroduce subject;ndn, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow fwhat he must have endured, he replied, “say
nothing that. who should suffer but myself? has been my own doing,
i ought feel.”

“you must not beo severe upon yourself,” replied elizabeth.

“you may well warn megainst suchn evil. human nature is so prone
fallto! no, lizzy, let me once my life feel how much i have
been blame. im notfraid being overpowered by impression.
will passway soon enough.”

“do you supposem be london?”

“yes; where else cany be so well concealed?”

“lydiused want go london,”dded kitty.

“she is happyn,” said her father drily; “her residencere
will probably be some duration.”

thenfter short silence he continued:

“lizzy, i bear you no ill-will fbeing justified yourdvice me
last may, which, considering event, shows some greatness mind.”

they wereterrupted by miss bennet, who came fetch her mother's
tea.

“is parade,” he cried, “which does one good; gives suchn
elegance misfortune!nother day i will do same; i will smy
library, my nightcapnd powdering gown,nd gives much troubles
i can;, perhaps, i may defer till kitty runsway.”

“im not going runway, papa,” said kitty fretfully. “if i should
ever go brighton, i would behave better than lydia.”

“_you_ go brighton. i would not trust you so nears eastbourne
ffifty pounds! no, kitty, i havet last learnt be cautious,nd
you will feel effects. noficer is ever enterto
my housegain, neven pass through village. balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stup one your sisters.
youre never stir out doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes every day rational manner.”

kitty, whookllse threats serious light, began cry.

“well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. if youre good
girl fnext ten years, i will take you reviewt end
them.”

two daysfter mr. bennet's return,s janend elizabeth were walking
together shrubbery behind house,y saw housekeeper
comingwardsm,nd, concluding that she came callmir
mother, went forward meet her; but,stead expected summons,
whenypproached her, she said miss bennet, “i beg your pardon,
madam, finterrupting you, but i was hopes you might have got some
good news fromwn, so iok liberty comingsk.”

“what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing fromwn.”

“dear madam,” cried mrs. hill, greatstonishment, “don't you know
there isn express come fmaster from mr. gardiner? he has been here
half-hour,nd master has had letter.”

away ran girls,o eager get have time fspeech.y

seeking him up stairsir mother, wheny were met by

pursuing his waywards small wood on one side paddock.

jane, who was not so light nso much habrunnings
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting fbreath,
came up him,nd eagerly cried out:

“oh, papa, what news--what news? have you heard from my uncle?”

“yes i have had letter from him by express.”

“well,nd what news does bring--good bad?”

“what isre good be expected?” said he, taking letter from
his pocket. “but perhaps you would like read.”

elizabeth impatiently caught from his hand. jane now came up.

“readloud,” saidir father, “fi hardly know myself what is

“gracechurch street, monday,ugust 2.

“my dear brother,

“then iss ilways hoped,” cried jane; “theyre married!”

“edw. gardiner.”

“is possible?” cried elizabeth, when she had finished. “can be
possible that he will marry her?”

“wickham is not so undeserving,n,s we thought him,” said her
sister. “my dear father, i congratulate you.”

“have younswered letter?” cried elizabeth.

“no; but must be done soon.”

most earnestly did shen entreat him lose no more time before he
wrote.

“oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come backnd write immediately.
consider how important every moment is such case.”

“let me write fyou,” said jane, “if you dislike trouble
yourself.”

“i dislike very much,” he replied; “but must be done.”

so saying, he turned backm,nd walkedwards house.

“may isk--” said elizabeth; “but terms, i suppose, must be
complied.”

“complied! im onlyshamed hissking so little.”

“they _must_ marry! yet he is _such_ man!”

“yes, yes,y must marry.re is nothing else be done. butre
are two things that i want very much know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down bringbout;nd other, howm i ever
pay him.”

“money! my uncle!” cried jane, “what do you mean, sir?”

“i mean, that no man his senses would marry lydion so slight
temptations one hundred year during my life,nd fiftyfter im
gone.”

“that is very true,” said elizabeth; “though had not occurred me
before. his debts be discharged,nd something still remain! oh!
must be my uncle's doings! generous, good man, imfraid he has
distressed himself. small sum could not doll.”

“no,” said her father; “wickham's fool if he takes her farthing
less than ten thouspounds. i should be sorry think so ill him,
very beginning our relationship.”

“ten thouspounds! heaven forbid! how is half such sum be
repaid?”

mr. bennet made nonswer,nd eachm, deep thought, continued
silent tilly reached house.ir fathern went on
library write,nd girls walkedbreakfast-room.

“theyre really be married!” cried elizabeth,s soonsy
were bymselves. “how strange is!nd f_this_ were be
thankful. thaty should marry, smalls isir chance happiness,
wretcheds is his character, were forced rejoice. oh, lydia!”

“i comfort myself thinking,” replied jane, “that he certainly would
not marry lydiif he had not real regard fher. though our kind
uncle has done somethingwards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thouspounds,nything like, has beendvanced. he has children
his own,nd may have more. how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?”

“if he were everble learn what wickham's debts have been,” said
elizabeth, “how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr. gardiner has done form, because wickham has
not sixpence his own. kindness my unclendunt can never
be requited.ir taking her home,ndffording herir personal
protectionnd countenance, is such sacrifice herdvantages
years gratitude cannot enoughcknowledge. by time she is

she will never deserve be happy! what meeting fher, when she
first sees myunt!”

“we must endeavour forgetll that has passed on either side,” said
jane: “i hopend trusty will yet be happy. his consenting
marry her is proof, i will believe, that he is come right way
thinking.ir mutualffection will steadym;nd i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly,nd live so rational manner,s may
time makeir past imprudence forgotten.”

“their conduct has been such,” replied elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
i, nornybody can ever forget. is useless talk.”

now occurred girls thatir mother wasll likelihood
perfectly ignorant what had happened.y went library,
therefore,ndskedir father whether he would not wishm make
known her. he was writingnd,out raising his head, coolly
replied:

“justs you please.”

“may we take my uncle's letter read her?”

“take whatever you like,nd getway.”

elizabethok letter from his writing-table,ndy went up stairs
together. marynd kitty were both mrs. bennet: one communication
would,refore, do forll.fter slight preparation fgood news,
letter was readloud. mrs. bennet could hardly contaherself.s
soons jane had read mr. gardiner's hope lydia's being soon
married, her joy burst forth,nd every following sentenceddeds
exuberance. she was nown irritations violent from delight,s she
had ever been fidgety fromlarmnd vexation. know that her daughter
would be married was enough. she was disturbed by no fear fher
felicity, nhumbled byny remembrance her misconduct.

“my dear, dear lydia!” she cried. “is delightfuldeed! she will
be married! i shall see hergain! she will be marriedt sixteen!
my good, kind brother! i knew how would be. i knew he would manage
everything! how i long see her!nd see dear wickhamo! but

how much he will give her. stay, stay, i will go myself. ring bell,
kitty, fhill. i will put on my things moment. my dear, dear
lydia! how merry we shall begether when we meet!”

her eldest daughter endeavoured give some relief violence
these transports, by leading her thoughts obligations which mr.
gardiner's behaviour laidmll under.

“fwe mustttribute happy conclusion,” shedded, “great
measure his kindness. were persuaded that he has pledged himself
assist mr. wickham money.”

“well,” cried her mother, “isll very right; who should do but
her own uncle? if he had not had family his own,d my children
must have hadll his money, you know;nd is first time we have
ever hadnything from him, except few presents. well! im so happy!

she wasn proceedingll particulars calico, muslin,nd
cambric,nd would shortly have dictated some very plentifulders, had

chapter 50


mr. bennet had veryten wished before period his life that,
instead spending his wholecome, he had laid bynnnual sum for
better provision his children,nd his wife, if she survived
him. he now wished more than ever. had he done his duty that

he was seriously concerned that cause so littledvantagenyone
should be forwardedt sole expense his brother-in-law,nd he
was determined, if possible, find out extent hisssistance,
discharge obligations soons he could.

when first mr. bennet had married, economy was held be perfectly
useless, for, course,y were have son. son was join
cuttingf entail,s soons he should bege,nd widow
younger children would by that means be provided for. five daughters
successively entered world, but yet son was come;nd mrs.
bennet, fmany yearsfter lydia's birth, had been certathat he
would. event hadt last been despaired, but wasn
too late be saving. mrs. bennet had no turn feconomy,nd her
husband's lovedependence hadlone preventedir exceedingir
income.

five thouspounds was settled by marriagerticles on mrs. bennetnd
children. but what proportions should be dividedmongst
latter depended on will parents. was one point,
regard lydia,t least, which was now be settled,nd mr. bennet
could have no hesitationcceding proposal before him.
terms gratefulcknowledgment fkindness his brother,
though expressed most concisely, hen delivered on paper his perfect
approbationll that was done,nd his willingness fulfil
engagements that had been made fhim. he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on marry his daughter, would
be done so littleconvenience himselfs by present
arrangement. he would scarcely be ten pounds year loser by
hundred that was be paidm; for, what her boardnd pocket
allowance,nd continual presents money which passed her
through her mother's hands, lydia's expenses had been very littlein
that sum.

that would be done such trifling exertion on his side,o, was
another very welcome surprise; fhis wisht present was haves
little trouble businesss possible. when first transports
rage which had produced hisctivity seeking her were over, he
naturally returnedll his formerdolence. his letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory undertaking business, he was quick
ins execution. he begged know further particulars what he
wasdebted his brother, but wasongry lydisendny
message her.

good news spread quickly through house,nd proportionate
speed through neighbourhood. was borne latter decent
philosophy. be sure, would have been more fordvantage

good-natured wishes fher well-doing which had proceeded before from
all spiteful old ladies meryton lost but littleir spirit
change circumstances, because suchn husbher misery
was considered certain.

was fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs; but on
happy day shegainok her seatt head her table,nd
spirits oppressively high. no sentiment shame gave damp her
triumph. marriage daughter, which had been first object
her wishes since jane was sixteen, was now on point
accomplishment,nd her thoughtsnd her words ran wholly on those
attendants elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages,nd
servants. she was busily searching through neighbourhood for
proper situation fher daughter,nd,out knowing considering
whatircome might be, rejected manys deficient sizend
importance.

“haye park might do,” said she, “if gouldings could quit--or
great houset stoke, if drawing-room were larger; butshworth is
too farf! i could not bear have her ten miles from me;nds for
pulvis lodge,tticsre dreadful.”

her husbandllowed her talk onoutterruption while
servants remained. but wheny haddrawn, he said her: “mrs.
bennet, before you takenyllse houses fyour sonnd
daughter, let us come right understanding._one_ house
neighbourhoody shall never havedmittance. i will not encourage
impudence either, by receivingmt longbourn.”

long dispute followed declaration; but mr. bennet was firm.
soon lednother;nd mrs. bennet found,mazementnd horror,
that her husbwould notdvance guinebuy clothes fhis
daughter. he protested that she should receive from him no mark
affection whatever on occasion. mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
it. that hisnger could be carried such pointconceivable
resentments refuse his daughter privilegeout which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceededll she could believe
possible. she was morelive disgrace which her want new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, thanny sense
shamet her elopingnd living wickham fortnight beforey
took place.

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from distress
moment, been led make mr. darcycquaintedir fears for
her sister; fsince her marriage would so shortly give
proper termination elopement,y might hope conceals
unfavourable beginning fromll those who were not immediately on
spot.

she had no fears spreading farther through his means.re were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but,t same time,re was no one whose knowledge sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, fromny fear
disadvantage fromdividually herself, for,tny rate,
there seemed gulf impassable betweenm. had lydia's marriage been
concluded on most honourable terms, was not be supposed that
mr. darcy would connect himself family where, every other
objection, would now beddednlliancend relationship
nearest kind man whom he so justly scorned.

from such connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.
wish procuring her regard, which she hadssured herself his
feeling derbyshire, could not rational expectation survive such
blows. she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew what. she became jealous his esteem, when she could no
longer hope be benefited by. she wanted hear him, whenre
seemed least chance gainingtelligence. she was convinced that
she could have been happy him, when was no longer likelyy
should meet.

what triumph fhim,s sheten thought, could he know that
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four monthsgo, would now
have been most gladlynd gratefully received! he wass generous, she
doubted not,s most generous his sex; but while he was mortal,
there must be triumph.

she began now comprehend that he was exactly man who,
dispositionnd talents, would most suher. his understandingnd
temper, though unlike her own, would havensweredll her wishes.
wasn union that must have beendvantage both; by her ease
liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
from his judgement,formation,nd knowledge world, she
must have received benefgreater importance.

but no such happy marriage could now teachdmiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.n union different tendency,nd
precluding possibility other, was soon be formedir
family.

how wickhamnd lydiwere be supportedlerabledependence,
she could not imagine. but how little permanent happiness could
belong couple who were only broughtgether becauseir passions
were stronger thanir virtue, she could easily conjecture.

mr. gardiner soon wrotegahis brother. mr. bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied,ssurance his eagerness

that subject might never be mentioned himgain. principal
purport his letter wasformm that mr. wickham had resolved
on quitting militia.

“was greatly my wish that he should do so,” hedded, “as soons

“e. gardiner.”

mr. bennetnd his daughters sawlldvantages wickham's removal
from ----shires clearlys mr. gardiner could do. but mrs. bennet
was not so well pleased. lydia's being settled north,
just when she had expected most pleasurend pride her company,
fshe had by no means given up her planir residing
hertfordshire, was severe disappointment;nd, besides, was such
pity that lydishould be taken from regiment where she wascquainted

surprised, however, that wickham should consent such scheme,nd
had she consulted only her ownclination,ny meeting him would
have been last object her wishes.



chapter 51


their sister's wedding dayrrived;nd janend elizabeth felt fher
probably more than she felt fherself. carriage was sent
meetmt ----,ndy were return by dinner-time.ir
arrival was dreaded by elder miss bennets,nd jane more especially,
who gave lydifeelings which would havettended herself, had she
been culprit,nd was wretched thought what her sister
must endure.

they came. family weressembled breakfast room receive
them. smiles decked face mrs. bennets carriage drove up
door; her husblooked impenetrably grave; her daughters,larmed,
anxious, uneasy.

lydia's voice was heard vestibule; dowas thrown open,nd
she ranroom. her mother stepped forwards, embraced her,nd
welcomed her rapture; gave her hand,nffectionate smile,
wickham, who followed his lady;nd wishedm both joyn
alacrity which shewed no doubtir happiness.

their reception from mr. bennet, whomyn turned, was not quite
so cordial. his countenance rather gainedusterity;nd he scarcely
opened his lips. easyssurance young couple,deed, was
enough provoke him. elizabeth was disgusted,nd even miss bennet
was shocked. lydiwas lydistill; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
fearless. she turned from sister sister, demandingir
congratulations;nd whent lengthyll sat down, looked eagerly
round room,ok notice some littlelteration,nd
observed, laugh, that was great while since she had been
there.

wickham was nottll more distressed than herself, but his manners
werelways so pleasing, that had his characternd his marriage been
exactly whaty ought, his smilesnd his easyddress, while he
claimedir relationship, would have delightedmll. elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal suchssurance; but she sat down,
resolvingherself draw no limits future impudence
ofn impudent man. she blushed,nd jane blushed; but cheeks
two who causedir confusion suffered no variation colour.

there was no want discourse. bridend her mother could neither
ofm talk fast enough;nd wickham, who happened snear
elizabeth, beganquiringfter hiscquaintance that neighbourhood,
good humoured ease which she felt very unable equal her
replies.y seemed eachm have happiest memories
world. nothing past was recollected pain;nd lydiled
voluntarily subjects which her sisters would not havelluded for
world.

“only thinks being three months,” she cried, “since i wentway;
seems but fortnight i declare;nd yetre have been things
enough happened time. good gracious! when i wentway, im sure
i had no more idebeing married till i came backgain! though i
thought would be very good fun if i was.”

her father lifted up his eyes. jane was distressed. elizabeth looked
expressivelyt lydia; but she, who never heard nsawnything
which she chose besensible, gaily continued, “oh! mamma, do
people hereabouts know im married-day? i wasfraidy might not;
we overtook william goulding his curricle, so i was determined he
should know,nd so i let down side-glass next him,ndok
off my glove,nd let my hjust rest upon window frame, so that
he might see ring,ndn i bowednd smiled likenything.”

elizabeth could bear no longer. she got up,nd ran out room;
returned no more, till she heardm passing through hall
dining parlour. shen joinedm soon enough see lydia,
anxious parade, walk up her mother's right hand,nd hear her say
her eldest sister, “ah! jane, i take your place now,nd you must go
lower, because im married woman.”

was not be supposed that time would give lydithat embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly freet first. her easend good
spiritscreased. she longed see mrs. phillips, lucases,nd
allir other neighbours,nd hear herself called “mrs. wickham”
 by eachm;nd mean time, she wentfter dinner show her
ring,nd boast being married, mrs. hillnd two housemaids.

“well, mamma,” said she, wheny werell returned breakfast
room, “what do you think my husband? is not he charming man? i
am sure my sisters mustll envy me. i only hopey may have half
my good luck.y mustll go brighton. that is place get
husbands. what pity is, mamma, we did notll go.”

“very true;nd if i had my will, we should. but my dear lydia, i don't
atll like your going such wayf. must be so?”

“oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing that. i shall likell
things. yound papa,nd my sisters, must come downnd see us. we
shall bet newcastlell winter,nd i dare sayre will be some
balls,nd i will take care get good partners formll.”

“i should like beyondnything!” said her mother.

“then when you goway, you may leave one two my sisters
behind you;nd i dare say i shall get husbands form before
winter is over.”

“i thank you fmy share favour,” said elizabeth; “but i do not
particularly like your way getting husbands.”

their visitors were not remainbove ten daysm. mr. wickham
had received his commission before he left london,nd he was join
his regimentt end fortnight.

no one but mrs. bennet regretted thatir stay would be so short;nd
she made most time by visitingbout her daughter,nd
having very frequent partiest home.se parties werecceptable
all;void family circle was even more desirable suchs did
think, than suchs did not.

wickham'sffection flydiwas just what elizabeth had expected
find; not equal lydia's fhim. she had scarcely needed her
present observation be satisfied, from reason things, that
their elopement had been brought on by strength her love, rather
than by his;nd she would have wondered why,out violently caring
fher, he chose elope hertll, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress circumstances;nd
if that were case, he was not young man resistn opportunity
having companion.

lydiwas exceedingly fond him. he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was be put competition him. he did every
thing best world;nd she was sure he would kill more birds on
first september, thanny body else country.

one morning, soonfterirrrival,s she was sitting her two
elder sisters, she said elizabeth:

“lizzy, i never gave _you_nccount my wedding, i believe. you
were not by, when ild mammothersllbout.re not you
curious hear how was managed?”

“no really,” replied elizabeth; “i thinkre cannot beo little said
on subject.”

“la! youre so strange! but i must tell you how wentf. we were
married, you know,t st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were
that parish.nd was settled that we shouldll bere by eleven
o'clock. my unclenduntnd i were gogether;nd others
were meet ust church. well, monday morning came,nd i was
such fuss! i was sofraid, you know, that something would happen
putf,ndn i should have gone quite distracted.ndre was
myunt,ll time i was dressing, preachingnd talkingway justs
if she was reading sermon. however, i did not hearbove one word
ten, fi was thinking, you may suppose, my dear wickham. i longed
know whether he would be married his blue coat.”

“well,nd so we breakfastedt tens usual; i thought would never
be over; for, by bye, youre understand, that my unclendunt
were horrid unpleasantll time i wasm. if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out doors, though i wasre
fortnight. not one party, scheme,nything. be sure london was
rather thin, but, however, littleatre was open. well,nd so
justs carriage came door, my uncle was calledway upon
business that horrid man mr. stone.ndn, you know, when once
they getgether,re is no end. well, i was so frightened i
did not know what do, fmy uncle was give meway;nd if we
were beyond hour, we could not be marriedll day. but, luckily, he
came backgaten minutes' time,ndn well set out. however,
i recollectedfterwards that if he had been prevented going,
wedding need not be putf, fmr. darcy might have dones well.”

“mr. darcy!” repeated elizabeth, uttermazement.

“oh, yes!--he was comere wickham, you know. but gracious
me! i quite forgot! i ought not have said wordbout. i promised
them so faithfully! what will wickham say? was be such secret!”

“if was be secret,” said jane, “say notnother word on
subject. you may depend upon my seeking no further.”

“oh! certainly,” said elizabeth, though burning curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”

“thank you,” said lydia, “fif you did, i should certainly tell you
all,ndn wickham would bengry.”

on such encouragementsk, elizabeth was forced put out her
power, by runningway.

but live ignorance on such point was impossible;t least
was impossible not try finformation. mr. darcy had beent
her sister's wedding. was exactly scene,nd exactlymong people,
where he hadpparently least do,nd least temptation go.
conjecturess meaning, rapidnd wild, hurriedher
brain; but she was satisfied none. those that best pleased her,s
placing his conduct noblest light, seemed most improbable. she
could not bear such suspense;nd hastily seizing sheet paper,
wrote short letter herunt, requestn explanation what
lydihad dropt, if were compatible secrecy which had been
intended.

“you may readily comprehend,” shedded, “what my curiosity must be
know how person unconnectedny us,nd (comparatively
speaking) stranger our family, should have beenmongst yout such
time. pray writestantly,nd let me understand--unless is,
fvery cogent reasons, remasecrecy which lydiseems
think necessary;ndn i must endeavour be satisfied
ignorance.”

“not that i _shall_, though,” shedded herself,s she finished
letter; “my dearunt, if you do not tell men honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced tricksnd stratagems find
out.”

jane's delicate sense honour would notllow her speak
elizabeth privately what lydihad let fall; elizabeth was glad
of;--tillppeared whether herquiries would receiveny
satisfaction, she had rather beout confidante.

elizabeth had satisfaction receivingnnswer her letters
soons she possibly could. she was no sooner possession
than, hurryinglittle copse, where she was least likely
beterrupted, she sat down on one benchesnd prepared

“gracechurch street, sept. 6.

“my dear niece,

“i have just received your letter,nd shall devote whole morning

“on very day my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had most
unexpected visitor. mr. darcy called,nd was shut up him several
hours. wasll over before irrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully rackeds _yours_ seems have been. he came tell mr.
gardiner that he had found out where your sisternd mr. wickham were,
that he had seennd talkedm both; wickham repeatedly,

after ourselves,nd camewn resolution hunting for

himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well knowns

confessed that he had before thought beneath him lay his private

an evil which had been brought on by himself. if he _hadnother_

he found lydiabsolutely resolved on remaining where she was. she cared

his very first conversation wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. he confessed himself obliged leave regiment,

scrupled not layll ill-consequences lydia's flight on her

home was exactly piece,ndrefore what i now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. i talked her repeatedly most

done,ndll unhappiness she had brought on her family. if she
heard me, was by good luck, fim sure she did not listen. i was
sometimes quite provoked, butn i recollected my dear elizabethnd

she was roused from her seat,nd her reflections, by some one's
approach;nd before she could striketonother path, she was
overtaken by wickham.

“imfraid iterrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,

“that you were gonetormy,nd she wasfraid had--not turned
out well.t such distances _that_, you know, thingsre strangely
misrepresented.”

“certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soonfterwards said:

“i was surprised see darcywn last month. we passed each other
several times. i wonder what he can be doingre.”

“perhaps preparing fhis marriage miss de bourgh,” said
elizabeth. “must be something particular, take himret

chapter 53


mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied conversation that he
nevergadistressed himself, provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
bytroducing subject;nd she was pleased find that she
had said enough keep him quiet.

day hisnd lydia's departure soon came,nd mrs. bennet was
forced submseparation, which,s her husbby no means
enteredher schemeirll going newcastle, was likely
continuet least twelvemonth.

“oh! my dear lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meetgain?”

“oh, lord! i don't know. notse two three years, perhaps.”

“write me veryten, my dear.”

“astens i can. but you know married women have never much time for
writing. my sisters may write _me_.y will have nothing else
do.”

mr. wickham'sdieus were much moreffectionate than his wife's. he
smiled, looked handsome,nd said many pretty things.

“he iss fine fellow,” said mr. bennet,s soonsy were out
house, “as ever i saw. he simpers,nd smirks,nd makes love
usll. im prodigiously proud him. i defy even sir william lucas
himself produce more valuable son-in-law.”

loss her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull fseveral days.

“iten think,” said she, “thatre is nothing so bads parting
one's friends. one seems so forlornoutm.”

“is consequence, you see, madam, marrying daughter,” said
elizabeth. “must make you better satisfied that your other fourre
single.”

“is no such thing. lydidoes not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband's regiment happens be so farf. if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”

but spiritless condition which event threw herwas shortly
relieved,nd her mind openedgaingitation hope, byn
article news whichn began be circulation. housekeeper
at netherfield had receivedders prepare forrrival her
master, who was coming down day two, shootre fseveral
weeks. mrs. bennet was quite fidgets. she lookedt jane,nd
smilednd shook her head by turns.

“well, well,nd so mr. bingley is coming down, sister,” (fmrs.
phillips first brought her news). “well, so much better. not
that i carebout, though. he is nothing us, you know,nd im
sure _i_ never want see himgain. but, however, he is very welcome
come netherfield, if he likes.nd who knows what _may_ happen?
but that is nothing us. you know, sister, wegreed longgo never
mention wordbout.nd so, is quite certahe is coming?”

“you may depend on,” replied other, “fmrs. nicholls was
meryton last night; i saw her passing by,nd went out myself on purpose
know truth;nd sheld me that was certatrue. he
comes down on thursdayt latest, very likely on wednesday. she was
going butcher's, sheld me, on purposeder some meat on
wednesday,nd she has got three couple ducks just fbe killed.”

miss bennet had not beenble hear his comingout changing
colour. was many months since she had mentioned his name
elizabeth; but now,s soonsy werelonegether, she said:

“i saw you lookt me-day, lizzy, when myuntld us present
report;nd i know ippeared distressed. but don't imagine was from
any silly cause. i was only confused fmoment, because i felt that
i _should_ be lookedt. i dossure you that news does notffect
me either pleasure pain. im glad one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see less him. not that imfraid
_myself_, but i dread other people's remarks.”

elizabeth did not know what make. had she not seen him
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable comingre no
other view than what wascknowledged; but she still thought him partial
jane,nd she wavereds greater probability his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, being bold enough come
without.

“yet is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that poman cannot
come house which he has legally hired,out raisingll
speculation! i _will_ leave him himself.”

spite what her sister declared,nd really believed be her
feelings expectation hisrrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits wereffected by.y were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she hadten seenm.

subject which had been so warmly canvassed betweenir parents,
about twelvemonthgo, was now brought forwardgain.

“as soons ever mr. bingley comes, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “you
will waon him course.”

“no, no. you forced mevisiting him last year,nd promised, if i
went see him, he should marry one my daughters. but ended
nothing,nd i will not be sent on fool's errandgain.”

his wife represented him howbsolutely necessary suchnttention
would be fromll neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning
netherfield.

“'tisn etiquette i despise,” said he. “if he wants our society,
let him seek. he knows where we live. i will not spend my hours
runningfter my neighbours every timey gowaynd come back
again.”

“well,ll i know is, that will bebominably rude if you do not wait
on him. but, however, that shan't prevent mysking him dine here, i
am determined. we must have mrs. longnd gouldings soon. that will
make thirteen ourselves, sore will be just roomt table for
him.”

consoled by resolution, she was betterble bear her
husband'scivility; though was very mortifying know that her
neighbours mightll see mr. bingley, consequence, before
_they_ did.s day hisrrival drew near,--

“i begbe sorry that he comestll,” said jane her sister. “it
would be nothing; i could see him perfectdifference, but i can
hardly bear hear thus perpetually talked. my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much i suffer from what she
says. happy shall i be, when his stayt netherfield is over!”

“i wish i could saynything comfort you,” replied elizabeth; “but
is wholly out my power. you must feel;nd usual satisfaction
preaching patience sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”

mr. bingleyrrived. mrs. bennet, throughssistance servants,
contrived have earliest tidings, that periodnxiety
fretfulness on her side might bes longs could. she counted
days that musttervene beforeirvitation could be sent;
hopeless seeing him before. but on third morningfter his
arrival hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter paddocknd ridewards house.

her daughters were eagerly called partake her joy. jane resolutely
kept her placet table; but elizabeth, satisfy her mother, went
window--she looked,--she saw mr. darcy him,nd sat down
agaby her sister.

“there is gentleman him, mamma,” said kitty; “who can be?”

“somecquaintance other, my dear, i suppose; im sure i do not
know.”

“la!” replied kitty, “looks just like that man that used be
him before. mr. what's-his-name. that tall, proud man.”

“good gracious! mr. darcy!--so does, i vow. well,ny friend
mr. bingley's willlways be welcome here, be sure; but else i must
say that i hate very sight him.”

jane lookedt elizabeth surprisend concern. she knew but little
ofir meeting derbyshire,ndrefore felt forwkwardness
which mustttend her sister, seeing himlmost ffirst time
after receiving his explanatory letter. both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. each felt fother,nd course formselves;ndir
mother talked on, her dislike mr. darcy,nd her resolution be
civil him onlys mr. bingley's friend,out being heard by either
ofm. but elizabeth had sources uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane, whom she had never yet had courage shew mrs.
gardiner's letter, relate her own change sentimentwards him.
jane, he could be only man whose proposals she had refused,
whose mershe had undervalued; but her own more extensive
information, he was person whom whole family weredebted
ffirst benefits,nd whom she regarded herselfn
interest, if not quite so tender,t leasts reasonablend justs
what jane felt fbingley. herstonishmentt his coming--at his
coming netherfield, longbourn,nd voluntarily seeking hergain,
waslmost equal what she had known on first witnessing hisltered
behaviour derbyshire.

colour which had been driven from her face, returned fhalf
minutendditional glow,nd smile delightdded lustre
her eyes,s she thought fthat space time that hisffectionnd
wishes must still be unshaken. but she would not be secure.

“let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “willn be early
enough fexpectation.”

she sattentlyt work, striving be composed,ndout daring
lift up her eyes, tillnxious curiosity carriedm face
her sisters servant waspproaching door. jane looked little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. on
gentlemen'sppearing, her colourcreased; yet she receivedm
tolerable ease,nd propriety behaviour equally free fromny
symptom resentmentny unnecessary complaisance.

elizabeth saids little eithers civility wouldllow,nd sat down
agaher work,n eagerness which did notten command. she
had ventured only one glancet darcy. he looked serious,s usual;nd,
she thought, mores he had been used look hertfordshire, thans
she had seen himt pemberley. but, perhaps he could not her mother's
presence be what he was before her unclendunt. was painful, but
notn improbable, conjecture.

bingley, she had likewise seen fornstant,nd that short period
saw him looking both pleasednd embarrassed. he was received by mrs.
bennet degree civility which made her two daughtersshamed,
especially when contrasted coldnd ceremonious politeness

elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed latter
preservation her favourite daughter from irremediablefamy,
was hurtnd distressed most painful degree by distinction so ill
applied.

darcy,fterquiring her how mr.nd mrs. gardiner did, question
which she could notnswerout confusion, said scarcelynything. he
was not seated by her; perhaps that was reason his silence; but
had not been so derbyshire.re he had talked her friends,
when he could not herself. but now several minutes elapsedout
bringing sound his voice;nd when occasionally, unable resist
impulse curiosity, she raised her eyes his face, shesten
found him lookingt janest herself,nd frequently on no object but
ground. more thoughtfulnessnd lessnxiety please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. she was disappointed,ndngry
herself fbeing so.

“could i expect be otherwise!” said she. “yet why did he come?”

she was no humour fconversationnyone but himself;nd
him she had hardly courage speak.

shequiredfter his sister, but could do no more.

“is long time, mr. bingley, since you wentway,” said mrs. bennet.

he readilygreed.

“i began befraid you would never come backgain. people _did_ say
you meant quplace entirelyt michaelmas; but, however, i hope
is not true. great many changes have happened neighbourhood,
since you wentway. miss lucas is marriednd settled.nd one my

was my brother gardiner's drawing upo,nd i wonder how he came

bingley replied that he did,nd made his congratulations. elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. how mr. darcy looked,refore, she could
not tell.

“is delightful thing, be sure, have daughter well married,”
 continued her mother, “butt same time, mr. bingley, is very
hard have her taken such way from me.yre gone down
newcastle, place quite northward, seems,ndreyre stay
i do not know how long. his regiment isre; fi suppose you have
heard his leaving ----shire,nd his being goneto
regulars. thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
manys he deserves.”

elizabeth, who knew be levelledt mr. darcy, was such
misery shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. drew from her,
however, exertion speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before;nd shesked bingley whether he meant makeny stay
countryt present. few weeks, he believed.

“when you have killedll your own birds, mr. bingley,” said her mother,
“i beg you will come here,nd shoots manys you please on mr.
bennet's manor. im sure he will be vastly happy oblige you,nd
will savell best covies fyou.”

elizabeth's miserycreased,t such unnecessary, suchficious
attention! were same fair prospectriset presents had
flatteredm yeargo, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening same vexatious conclusion.t thatstant, she felt
that years happiness could not make jane herselfmends for
moments such painful confusion.

“first wish my heart,” said she herself, “is never more
be company eitherm.ir society canfford no pleasure
that willtone fsuch wretchednesss! let me never see either
one othergain!”

yet misery, fwhich years happiness werefer no
compensation, received soonfterwards material relief, from observing
how much beauty her sister re-kindleddmiration her
former lover. when first he came, he had spoken her but little;
but every five minutes seemed be giving her more histtention. he
found hers handsomes she had been last year;s good natured,nd
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. jane wasnxious that no
difference should be perceived hertll,nd was really persuaded
that she talkeds muchs ever. but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did notlways know when she was silent.

when gentlemen rose goway, mrs. bennet was mindful her
intended civility,ndy werevitednd engaged dinet
longbourn few days time.

“youre quite vismy debt, mr. bingley,” shedded, “fwhen
you wentwn last winter, you promised take family dinner
us,s soons you returned. i have not forgot, you see;nd issure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come backnd keep
your engagement.”

bingley looked little sillyt reflection,nd said something
his concernt having been prevented by business.yn wentway.

mrs. bennet had been stronglyclinedskm staynd dine
there that day; but, though shelways kept very good table, she did
not thinknything less than two courses could be good enough fman
on whom she had suchnxious designs, satisfyppetitend pride

chapter 54


as soonsy were gone, elizabeth walked out recover her spirits;
other words, dwelloutterruption on those subjects that
must deadenm more. mr. darcy's behaviourstonishednd vexed her.

“why, if he came only be silent, grave,nddifferent,” said she,
“did he cometll?”

she could settle no way that gave her pleasure.

“he could be stillmiable, still pleasing, my unclendunt, when
he waswn;nd why not me? if he fears me, why come hither? if
he no longer cares fme, why silent? teasing, teasing, man! i will
think no morebout him.”

her resolution was fshort timevoluntarily kept bypproach
her sister, who joined her cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfiedir visitors, than elizabeth.

“now,” said she, “that first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy. i know my own strength,nd i shall never be embarrassedgaby
his coming. im glad he dines here on tuesday. willn be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet onlys commonnddifferent
acquaintance.”

“yes, verydifferentdeed,” said elizabeth, laughingly. “oh, jane,
take care.”

“my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak,s be danger now?”

“i think youre very great danger making hims much love
yous ever.”

                          * * * * *

they did not see gentlemengatill tuesday;nd mrs. bennet,
meanwhile, was giving wayll happy schemes, which good
humournd common politeness bingley, halfn hour's visit, had
revived.

on tuesdayre was large partyssembledt longbourn;nd two
who were mostnxiously expected, credofir punctuality
as sportsmen, were very good time. wheny repaired
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched see whether bingley would take
place, which,llir former parties, had belonged him, by
her sister. her prudent mother, occupied by same ideas, forbore
invite him sby herself. on entering room, he seemed
hesitate; but jane happened look round,nd happened smile: was
decided. he placed himself by her.

elizabeth, triumphant sensation, lookedwards his friend.
he bore nobledifference,nd she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turnedwards mr. darcy,n expression half-laughing
alarm.

his behaviour her sister was such, during dinner time,s showedn
admiration her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that if left wholly himself, jane's happiness,nd his
own, would be speedily secured. though she dared not depend upon
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.
gave herllnimation that her spirits could boast; fshe was
no cheerful humour. mr. darcy waslmosts far from hers table
could dividem. he was on one side her mother. she knew how little
such situation would give pleasure either, make eitherppear
advantage. she was not near enough hearnyir discourse, but
she could see how seldomy spoke each other,nd how formalnd
cold wasir manner whenevery did. her mother's ungraciousness,
made sense whaty owed him more painful elizabeth's mind;
she would,t times, have givennything be privileged tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nunfelt by whole
family.

she was hopes that evening wouldfford some opportunity
bringingmgether; that whole viswould not passway
without enablingm entersomething more conversation than
mere ceremonious salutationttending his entrance.nxious
uneasy, period which passed drawing-room, before
gentlemen came, was wearisomend dull degree thatlmost made her
uncivil. she looked forwardir entrances point on whichll
her chance pleasure fevening must depend.

“if he does not come me, _then_,” said she, “i shall give him up for
ever.”

gentlemen came;nd she thought he lookeds if he would have
answered her hopes; but,las! ladies had crowded round table,
where miss bennet was making tea,nd elizabeth pouring out coffee,
so close confederacy thatre was not single vacancy near her
which woulddmchair.nd on gentlemen'spproaching, one
girls moved closer her than ever,nd said, whisper:

“men shan't comend part us, im determined. we want nonem;
do we?”

darcy had walkedwaynother part room. she followed him
her eyes, envied everyone whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
helpnybody coffee;ndn was enragedgainst herself for
being so silly!

“man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough
expect renewal his love? isre onemong sex, who would not
protestgainst such weaknesss second proposal same woman?
there is nodignity sobhorrentir feelings!”

she was little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself;nd she seized opportunity saying:

“is your sistert pemberley still?”

“yes, she will remainre till christmas.”

“quitelone? havell her friends left her?”

“mrs.nnesley is her. others have been gone on scarborough,
these three weeks.”

she could think nothing more say; but if he wished converse
her, he might have better success. he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, silence;nd,t last, on young lady's whispering
elizabethgain, he walkedway.

when tea-things were removed,nd card-tables placed, ladies
all rose,nd elizabeth wasn hoping be soon joined by him,
whenll her views were overthrown by seeing him fall victim her
mother's rapacity fwhist players,nd few momentsfter seated
rest party. she now lost every expectation pleasure.
they were confined feveningt different tables,nd she had
nothing hope, but that his eyes were soten turnedwards her side
room,s make him plays unsuccessfullys herself.

mrs. bennet had designed keep two netherfield gentlemen
supper; butir carriage was unluckilydered beforeny
others,nd she had no opportunity detainingm.

“well girls,” said she,s soonsy were leftmselves, “what
say you day? i think every thing has passedf uncommonly well,
issure you. dinner wass well dressedsny i ever saw.
venison was roasted turn--everybody saidy never saw so
fat haunch. soup was fifty times better than what we hadt
lucases' last week;nd even mr. darcycknowledged, that partridges
were remarkably well done;nd i suppose he has two three french

what do you think she said besides? 'ah! mrs. bennet, we shall have her
at netherfieldt last.' she diddeed. i do think mrs. long iss good
creatures ever lived--her niecesre very pretty behaved girls,
nottll handsome: i likem prodigiously.”

mrs. bennet, short, was very great spirits; she had seen enough
bingley's behaviour jane, be convinced that she would get himt

“has been verygreeable day,” said miss bennet elizabeth. “the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one other. i hope we
mayten meetgain.”

elizabeth smiled.

“lizzy, you must not do so. you must not suspect me. mortifies me.
issure you that i have now learnt enjoy his conversationsn

perfectly satisfied, from what his manners nowre, that he never had
any design engaging myffection. is only that he is blessed

pleasing, thanny other man.”

“youre very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile,nd
are provoking me every moment.”

“how hard is some cases be believed!”

“how impossible others!”

“but why should you wish persuade me that i feel more than i

“that is question which i hardly know hownswer. well love

few daysfter visit, mr. bingley calledgain,ndlone. his
friend had left him that morning flondon, but was return home
ten days time. he satmboven hour,nd was remarkably
good spirits. mrs. bennetvited him dinem; but, many
expressions concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

“next time you call,” said she, “i hope we shall be more lucky.”

he should be particularly happytny time, etc. etc.;nd if she would
give him leave, would taken early opportunity waiting onm.

“can you come-morrow?”

yes, he had no engagementtll fto-morrow;nd hervitation was
acceptedlacrity.

he came,nd such very good time that ladies were nonem
dressed. ran mrs. bennet her daughter's room, her dressing
gown,nd her hair half finished, crying out:

“my dear jane, make hastend hurry down. he is come--mr. bingley is
come. he is,deed. make haste, make haste. here, sarah, come miss
bennet moment,nd help her on her gown. never mind miss
lizzy's hair.”

“we will be downs soons we can,” said jane; “but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either us, fshe went up stairs halfn hourgo.”

“oh! hang kitty! what has she do? come be quick, be quick!
where is your sash, my dear?”

but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on go down
without one her sisters.

samenxiety getm bymselves was visiblegain
evening.fter tea, mr. bennet retired library,s was his
custom,nd mary went up stairs herstrument. two obstacles
five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat lookingnd winkingt
elizabethnd catherine fconsiderable time,out makingny
impression onm. elizabeth would not observe her;nd whent last
kitty did, she verynocently said, “what is matter mamma? what do
you keep winkingt me for? whatm i do?”

“nothing child, nothing. i did not winkt you.” shen sat still
five minutes longer; but unable waste such precious occasion, she
suddenly got up,nd saying kitty, “come here, my love, i want
speak you,”ok her out room. janestantly gave look
at elizabeth which spoke her distresst such premeditation,nd her
entreaty that _she_ would not give. few minutes, mrs.
bennet half-opened doornd called out:

“lizzy, my dear, i want speak you.”

elizabeth was forced go.

“we mays well leavem bymselves you know;” said her mother,s
soons she was hall. “kittynd ire going up stairs sin
my dressing-room.”

elizabeth made nottempt reason her mother, but remained
quietly hall, till shend kitty were out sight,n returned
indrawing-room.

mrs. bennet's schemes fday wereeffectual. bingley was every
thing that was charming, except professed lover her daughter. his
easend cheerfulness rendered him mostgreeabledditionir
evening party;nd he bore ill-judgedficiousness
mother,nd heardll her silly remarks forbearancend command
countenance particularly grateful daughter.

he scarcely needednvitation stay supper;nd before he went
away,n engagement was formed, chiefly through his ownnd mrs.
bennet's means, fhis coming next morning shoot her husband.

after day, jane said no more herdifference. not word passed
between sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went bed
happy belief thatll must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
returnedstated time. seriously, however, she feltlerably
persuaded thatll must have taken place that gentleman's
concurrence.

bingley was punctual hisppointment;nd hend mr. bennet spent
morninggether,s had beengreed on. latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.re was nothing presumption
folly bingley that could provoke his ridicule, disgust himto
silence;nd he was more communicative,nd less eccentric, than
other had ever seen him. bingley course returned him dinner;
evening mrs. bennet'svention wasgaint work get
every bodyway from himnd her daughter. elizabeth, who had letter
write, wentbreakfast room fthat purpose soonfter tea;
fors others werell going sdown cards, she could not be
wanted counteract her mother's schemes.

but on returning drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, herfinite surprise,re was reason fear that her mother
had beenogenious fher. on opening door, she perceived her
sisternd bingley standinggether over hearth,s if engaged
earnest conversation;nd had led no suspicion, faces
both,sy hastily turned roundnd movedway from each other, would
haveldll.ir situation waswkward enough; but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. not syllable was uttered by either;nd
elizabeth was on point goingwaygain, when bingley, whos
wells other had sat down, suddenly rose,nd whispering few
words her sister, ran out room.

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure;ndstantly embracing her,cknowledged, liveliest
emotion, that she was happiest creature world.

“'tiso much!” shedded, “by faro much. i do not deserve. oh!
why is not everybodys happy?”

elizabeth's congratulations were given sincerity, warmth,
delight, which words could but poorly express. every sentence
kindness was fresh source happiness jane. but she would not
allow herself stay her sister, say half that remained be
said fpresent.

“i must gostantly my mother;” she cried. “i would not onny
account trifle herffectionate solicitude;llow her hear
fromnyone but myself. he is gone my fatherlready. oh! lizzy,
know that what i have relate will give such pleasurell my dear
family! how shall i bear so much happiness!”

shen hastenedway her mother, who had purposely broken up
card party,nd was sitting up stairs kitty.

elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiledt rapiditynd ease
whichnffair was finally settled, that had givenm so many
previous months suspensend vexation.

“and,” said she, “is endll his friend'snxious
circumspection!ll his sister's falsehoodnd contrivance!
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”

few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference her
father had been shortnd purpose.

“where is your sister?” said he hastily,s he opened door.

“my mother up stairs. she will be down moment, i dare say.”

hen shut door,nd, coming up her, claimed good wishes
andffection sister. elizabeth honestlynd heartily expressed
her delight prospectir relationship.y shook hands
great cordiality;ndn, till her sister came down, she had listen
toll he had say his own happiness,nd jane's perfections;
spite his being lover, elizabeth really believedll his
expectations felicity be rationally founded, becausey had for
basis excellent understanding,nd super-excellent disposition
jane,nd general similarity feelingnd taste between hernd
himself.

wasn evening no common delightmll; satisfaction
miss bennet's mind gave glow such sweetnimation her face,s
made her look handsomer than ever. kitty simperednd smiled,nd hoped
her turn was coming soon. mrs. bennet could not give her consent
speak herpprobation terms warm enough satisfy her feelings,
though she talked bingley nothing else fhalfn hour;nd when
mr. bennet joinedmt supper, his voicend manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

not word, however, passed his lipsllusion, tillir
visittook his leave fnight; buts soons he was gone, he
turned his daughter,nd said:

“jane, i congratulate you. you will be very happy woman.”

jane went himstantly, kissed him,nd thanked him fhis
goodness.

“youre good girl;” he replied, “i have great pleasure
thinking you will be so happily settled. i have not doubt your
doing very wellgether. your tempersre by no means unlike. youre
each you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you;nd so generous, that you will
always exceed yourcome.”

“i hope not so. imprudence thoughtlessness money matters would be
unpardonable me.”

“exceedircome! my dear mr. bennet,” cried his wife, “whatre you
talking? why, he has four five thousyear,nd very likely
more.”nddressing her daughter, “oh! my dear, dear jane, im so
happy! im sure i shan't get wink sleepll night. i knew how
would be. ilways said must be so,t last. i was sure you could not
be so beautiful fnothing! i remember,s soons ever i saw him, when
he first camehertfordshire last year, i thought how likely was
that you should comegether. oh! he is handsomest young man that
ever was seen!”

wickham, lydia, werell forgotten. jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.t that moment, she cared fno other. her younger
sisters soon began maketerest her fobjects happiness
which she might future beble dispense.

mary petitioned fuse libraryt netherfield;nd kitty
begged very hard ffew ballsre every winter.

bingley, from time, was course daily visitort longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast,ndlways remaining tillfter
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given himnvitation dinner which he thought himself
obligedccept.

elizabeth had now but little time fconversation her sister; for
while he was present, jane had nottention bestow onnyone else;
but she found herself considerably useful bothm those hours
separation that must sometimes occur.bsence jane, he
alwaysttached himself elizabeth, fpleasure talking
her;nd when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought same means
relief.

“he has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
wastally ignorant my beingwn last spring! i had not believed
possible.”

“i suspecteds much,” replied elizabeth. “but how did heccount for
it?”

“must have been his sister's doing.y were certainly no friends
hiscquaintance me, which i cannot wondert, since he might have
chosen so much moredvantageously many respects. but wheny see,
as i trusty will, thatir brother is happy me,y will
learn be contented,nd we shall be on good termsgain; though we
can never be what we once were each other.”

“that is most unforgiving speech,” said elizabeth, “that i ever
heard you utter. good girl! would vex me,deed, see yougain
dupe miss bingley's pretended regard.”

“would you believe, lizzy, that when he wentwn last november,
he really loved me,nd nothing but persuasion _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming downgain!”

“he made little mistake be sure; but is credhis
modesty.”

naturallytroduced panegyric from jane on his diffidence,nd
little value he put on his own good qualities. elizabeth was pleased
find that he had not betrayedterference his friend; for,
though jane had most generousnd forgiving heart world, she
knew was circumstance which must prejudice hergainst him.

“im certainly most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
jane. “oh! lizzy, whym i thus singled from my family,nd blessed
abovemll! if i could but see _you_s happy! ifre _were_ but
suchnother man fyou!”

“if you were give me forty such men, i never could be so happys
you. till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness. no, no, let me shift fmyself;nd, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meetnother mr. collins time.”

situationffairs longbourn family could not be long
secret. mrs. bennet was privileged whisper mrs. phillips,
she ventured,outny permission, do same byll her
neighbours meryton.

bennets were speedily pronounced be luckiest family
world, though only few weeks before, when lydihad first runway,
they had been generally proved be marked out fmisfortune.

one morning,bout weekfter bingley's engagement jane had been
formed,s hend females family were sittinggether
dining-room,irttention was suddenly drawn window, by
sound carriage;ndy perceived chaisend four driving up
lawn. waso early morning fvisitors,nd besides,
equipage did notnswer thatnyir neighbours. horses
were post;nd neither carriage, nlivery servant who
preceded, were familiarm.s was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingleystantly prevailed on miss bennetvoid
confinement suchntrusion,nd walkway himto
shrubbery.y both setf,nd conjectures remaining three
continued, though little satisfaction, till dowas thrown
openndir visitentered. was lady catherine de bourgh.

they were courselltending be surprised; butir
astonishment was beyondir expectation;nd on part mrs.
bennetnd kitty, though she was perfectly unknownm, even
inferiwhat elizabeth felt.

she entered roomnir more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply elizabeth's salutation than slightclination
head,nd sat downout saying word. elizabeth had mentioned her
name her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request
introduction had been made.

mrs. bennet,llmazement, though flattered by having guest such
high importance, received her utmost politeness.fter sitting
fmoment silence, she said very stiffly elizabeth,

“i hope youre well, miss bennet. that lady, i suppose, is your
mother.”

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

“_that_ i suppose is one your sisters.”

“yes, madam,” said mrs. bennet, delighted speak lady catherine.
“she is my youngest girl but one. my youngestll is lately married,
my eldest is somewherebout grounds, walking young man
who, i believe, will soon become part family.”

“you have very small park here,” returned lady catherinefter short
silence.

“is nothing comparison rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i
assure you is much larger than sir william lucas's.”

“must be mostconvenient sitting room fevening,
summer; windowsre full west.”

mrs. bennetssured her thaty never satrefter dinner,ndn
added:

“may i take libertysking your ladyship whether you left mr.nd
mrs. collins well.”

“yes, very well. i sawm night before last.”

elizabeth now expected that she would produce letter fher from
charlotte,s seemed only probable motive fher calling. but no
letterppeared,nd she was completely puzzled.

mrs. bennet, great civility, begged her ladyship take some
refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely,nd not very politely,
declined eatingnything;ndn, rising up, said elizabeth,

“miss bennet,re seemed be prettyish kind little wilderness
on one side your lawn. i should be glad take turn, if you
will favour me your company.”

“go, my dear,” cried her mother, “show her ladyshipbout
different walks. i think she will be pleased hermitage.”

elizabeth obeyed,nd runningher own room fher parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs.sy passed through
hall, lady catherine opened doorsdining-parlournd
drawing-room,nd pronouncingm,fter short survey, be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

her carriage remainedt door,nd elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was.y proceeded silencelong gravel walk
that led copse; elizabeth was determined make no effort for
conversation woman who was now more than usuallysolentnd
disagreeable.

“how could i ever think her like her nephew?” said she,s she looked
her face.

as soonsy entered copse, lady catherine began following
manner:--

“you can bet no loss, miss bennet, understreason my
journey hither. your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come.”

elizabeth looked unaffectedstonishment.

“indeed, youre mistaken, madam. i have not beentllbleccount
fhonour seeing you here.”

“miss bennet,” replied her ladyship,nngryne, “you ought
know, that im not be trifled. but howeversincere _you_ may
choose be, you shall not find _me_ so. my character has ever been
celebrated fors sinceritynd frankness,nd cause such
moments, i shall certainly not depart from. report most
alarming nature reached me two daysgo. i wasld that not only your
sister was on point being mostdvantageously married, but that
you, that miss elizabeth bennet, would,ll likelihood, be soon
afterwards united my nephew, my own nephew, mr. darcy. though i
_know_ must be scandalous falsehood, though i would notjure him
so muchs suppose truth possible, istantly resolved
on settingf fplace, that i might make my sentiments known
you.”

“if you believed impossible be true,” said elizabeth, colouring
withstonishmentnd disdain, “i wonder youok trouble coming
so far. what could your ladyship propose by?”

“at oncesist upon having such report universally contradicted.”

“your coming longbourn, see mend my family,” said elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather confirmation; if,deed, such report
is existence.”

“if! do youn pretend be ignorant? has not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such
report is spreadbroad?”

“i never heard that was.”

“can you likewise declare, thatre is no foundation for?”

“i do not pretend possess equal frankness your ladyship. you may
ask questions which i shall not choosenswer.”

“is not be borne. miss bennet, isist on being satisfied. has
he, has my nephew, made younfer marriage?”

“your ladyship has declared be impossible.”

“ought be so; must be so, while he retains use his
reason. but yourrtsndllurements may, momentfatuation,
have made him forget what he owes himselfndll his family. you
may have drawn him.”

“if i have, i shall be last person confess.”

“miss bennet, do you know who im? i have not beenccustomed such
languages. imlmost nearest relation he has world,
andm entitled knowll his dearest concerns.”

“but youre not entitled know mine; nwill such behaviours,
everduce me be explicit.”

“let me be rightly understood. match, which you have
presumptionspire, can never take place. no, never. mr. darcy is
engaged my daughter. now what have you say?”

“only; that if he is so, you can have no reason suppose he will
makenfer me.”

lady catherine hesitated fmoment,ndn replied:

“engagement betweenm is peculiar kind. fromirfancy,
they have beentended feach other. was favourite wish
_his_ mother,s wells hers. whileir cradles, we planned

hours he was destined fhis cousin?”

“yes,nd i had heard before. but what is that me? ifre is
no other objection my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not
be kept from by knowing that his motherndunt wished him
marry miss de bourgh. you both dids muchs you could planning
marriage.s completion depended on others. if mr. darcy is neither
by honour ninclination confined his cousin, why is not he make
another choice?nd if im that choice, why may not iccept him?”

“because honour, decorum, prudence, nay,terest, forbid. yes,
miss bennet,terest; fdo not expect be noticed by his family

be censured, slighted,nd despised, by everyone connected him.
yourlliance will be disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned

“thesere heavy misfortunes,” replied elizabeth. “but wife mr.
darcy must have such extraordinary sources happiness necessarily
attached her situation, that she could, upon whole, have no cause
repine.”

“obstinate, headstrong girl! imshamed you! is your gratitude

here determined resolution carrying my purpose; nwill

“_that_ will make your ladyship's situationt present more pitiable;
but will have no effect on me.”

“i will not beterrupted. hear me silence. my daughternd my
nephewre formed feach other.yre descended, on maternal
side, from same noble line;nd, on father's, from respectable,

were sensible your own good, you would not wish qusphere

“marrying your nephew, i should not consider myselfs quitting that

equal.”

“true. you _are_ gentleman's daughter. but who was your mother?
whore your unclesndunts? do not imagine me ignorantir

“whatever my connections may be,” said elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not objectm,y can be nothing _you_.”

“tell me once forll,re you engaged him?”

though elizabeth would not, fmere purpose obliging lady
catherine, havenswered question, she could not but say,fter
moment's deliberation:

“im not.”

lady catherine seemed pleased.

“will you promise me, never entersuchn engagement?”

“i will make no promise kind.”

“miss bennet im shockedndstonished. i expected find more
reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourselfbelief that
i will ever recede. i shall not goway till you have given me
assurance i require.”

“i certainly _never_ shall give. im not betimidatedto
anything so wholly unreasonable. your ladyship wants mr. darcy marry
your daughter; but would my giving you wished-fpromise makeir

my refusingccept his hmake him wish bestow on his cousin?
allow me say, lady catherine, thatrguments which you have
supported extraordinarypplication have beens frivolouss
application was ill-judged. you have widely mistaken my character, if
you think i can be worked on by such persuasionssse. how far your
nephew mightpprove yourterference hisffairs, i cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right concern yourself mine. i must beg,
therefore, be importuned no farther on subject.”

“not so hasty, if you please. i have by no means done.ll
objections i havelready urged, i have stillnotherdd. im

such girl be my nephew's sister? is her husband, is son his
late father's steward, be his brother? heavennd earth!--whatre
you thinking?re shades pemberley be thus polluted?”

“you can now have nothing further say,” she resentfullynswered.
“you havesulted me every possible method. i must beg return
house.”

she roses she spoke. lady catherine roselso,ndy turned
back. her ladyship was highlycensed.

“you have no regard,n, fhonournd credmy nephew!
unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that connection you
must disgrace him eyes everybody?”

“lady catherine, i have nothing further say. you know my sentiments.”

“youren resolved have him?”

“i have said no such thing. im only resolvedct that manner,
which will, my own opinion, constitute my happiness,out
reference _you_,ny person so wholly unconnected me.”

“is well. you refuse,n, oblige me. you refuse obey
claims duty, honour,nd gratitude. youre determined ruhim

“neither duty, nhonour, ngratitude,” replied elizabeth, “haveny

_were_ excited by his marrying me, would not give me one moment's

“is your real opinion! is your final resolve! very well.
i shall now know howct. do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. i came try you. i hoped find you
reasonable; but, depend upon, i will carry my point.”

manner lady catherine talked on, tilly weret doof

you, miss bennet. i send no compliments your mother. you deserve
no suchttention. im most seriously displeased.”

elizabeth made nonswer;ndoutttempting persuade her
ladyship returnhouse, walked quietlyherself. she
heard carriage driveways she proceeded up stairs. her mother
impatiently met hert dodressing-room,sk why lady
catherine would not comegainnd rest herself.

“she did not choose,” said her daughter, “she would go.”

“she is very fine-looking woman!nd her calling here was prodigiously
civil! fshe only came, i suppose, tell us collinses were
well. she is on her road somewhere, i dare say,nd so, passing through
meryton, thought she mights well call on you. i suppose she had
nothing particular say you, lizzy?”

elizabeth was forced givelittle falsehood here; fto

chapter 57


discomposure spirits which extraordinary visthrew
elizabethto, could not be easily overcome; ncould she, fmany
hours, learn think less thancessantly. lady catherine,
appeared, hadctually taken trouble journey from rosings,
fsole purpose breakingf her supposed engagement mr.
darcy. was rational scheme, be sure! but from what report
ofir engagement couldiginate, elizabeth wast loss imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ beingtimate friend bingley,
_her_ being sister jane, was enough,t time when
expectation one wedding made everybody eager fornother, supply
idea. she had not herself forgotten feel that marriage her
sister must bringm more frequentlygether.nd her neighbours
at lucas lodge,refore (fthroughir communication
collinses, report, she concluded, had reached lady catherine), had
only set that downslmost certainnd immediate, which she had looked
forwards possiblet some future time.

revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasinesss possible consequence her persisting
interference. from what she had said her resolution
preventir marriage, occurred elizabeth that she must meditate
anpplication her nephew;nd how _he_ might take similar
representation evilsttached connection her, she dared
not pronounce. she knew not exact degree hisffection fhis
aunt, his dependence on her judgment, but was natural suppose
that he thought much higher her ladyship than _she_ could do;nd
was certathat, enumerating miseries marriage _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal his own, hisunt would
address him on his weakest side. his notions dignity, he would
probably feel thatrguments, which elizabeth hadppeared weak
ridiculous, contained much good sensend solid reasoning.

if he had been wavering befores what he should do, which hadten
seemed likely,dvicend entreaty so near relation might
settle every doubt,nd determine himt once bes happys dignity
unblemished could make him. that case he would return no more. lady
catherine might see him her way throughwn;nd his engagement
bingley comingganetherfield must give way.

“if,refore,n excuse fnot keeping his promise should come his
friendfew days,” shedded, “i shall know how understand
it. i shalln give over every expectation, every wish his
constancy. if he is satisfied only regretting me, when he might
have obtained myffectionsnd hand, i shall soon cease regret him

surprise rest family, on hearing whoir visithad
been, was very great; buty obligingly satisfied, same
kind supposition which hadppeased mrs. bennet's curiosity;nd
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on subject.

next morning,s she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out his library letter his hand.

“lizzy,” said he, “i was going look fyou; comemy room.”

she followed him thither;nd her curiosity know what he had
tell her was heightened by suppositions being some manner
connected letter he held. suddenly struck her that
might be from lady catherine;nd shenticipated dismayll
consequent explanations.

she followed her father fire place,ndy both sat down. he
then said,

“i have received letter morning that hasstonished me
exceedingly.s principally concerns yourself, you ought knows
contents. i did not know before, that i had two daughters on brink
matrimony. let me congratulate you on very important conquest.”

she was undetermined whether most be pleased that he explained
himselftll,fended that his letter was not ratherddressed
herself; when her father continued:

“you look conscious. young ladies have great penetration such matters
asse; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, discover
name yourdmirer. letter is from mr. collins.”

“from mr. collins!nd what can _he_ have say?”

“something very much purpose course. he begins

“can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by? 'young

patronage. yet spitellse temptations, let me warn my cousin

“have youny idea, lizzy, who gentleman is? but now comes out:

“'my motive fcautioning you iss follows. we have reason imagine

“_mr. darcy_, you see, is man! now, lizzy, i think i _have_

“oh! yes. pray read on.”

chapter 58


instead receivingny such letter excuse from his friend,s
elizabeth half expected mr. bingley do, he wasble bring darcy
him longbourn before many days had passedfter lady catherine's
visit. gentlemenrrived early;nd, before mrs. bennet had time
tell himir having seen hisunt, which her daughter sat
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted belone jane, proposed
theirll walking out. wasgreed. mrs. bennet was not
habwalking; mary could never spare time; but remaining five
setfgether. bingleynd jane, however, soonllowed others
outstripm.y lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty,nd darcy
were entertaeach other. very little was said by either; kitty
waso muchfraid him talk; elizabeth was secretly forming
desperate resolution;nd perhaps he might be doing same.

they walkedwards lucases, because kitty wished call upon
maria;nds elizabeth saw no occasion fmaking general concern,
when kitty leftm she went boldly on himlone. now was
moment fher resolution be executed,nd, while her courage was
high, she immediately said:

“mr. darcy, im very selfish creature;nd, fsake giving
relief my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding yours. i
can no longer help thanking you fyour unexampled kindness my
posister. ever since i have known, i have been mostnxious
acknowledge you how gratefully i feel. were known rest
my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude express.”

“im sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied darcy,ne surprise
emotion, “that you have ever beenformed what may,
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. i did not think mrs. gardiner
was so little be trusted.”

“you must not blame myunt. lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed
me that you had been concerned matter;nd, course, i could
not rest till i knew particulars. let me thank yougainndgain,
namell my family, fthat generous compassion whichduced
you take so much trouble,nd bear so many mortifications, for
sake discoveringm.”

“if you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let be fyourselflone.
that wish giving happiness you mightdd force other
inducements which led me on, i shall notttempt deny. but your
_family_ owe me nothing. muchs i respectm, i believe i thought
only _you_.”

elizabeth waso much embarrassed say word.fter short pause,
her companiondded, “youreo generous trifle me. if your
feelingsre still whaty were lastpril, tell me sot once. _my_
affectionsnd wishesre unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on subject fever.”

elizabeth, feelingll more than commonwkwardnessndnxiety
his situation, now forced herself speak;nd immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him understthat her sentiments had undergone
so material change, since period which helluded,s make
her receive gratitudend pleasure his presentssurances.
happiness which reply produced, was suchs he had probably never
felt before;nd he expressed himself on occasions sensiblynds
warmlys man violently love can be supposed do. had elizabeth
beenble encounter his eye, she might have seen how well
expression heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen,nd held her
feelings, which, proving what importance she was him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

they walked on,out knowing what direction.re waso much
be thought,nd felt,nd said, forttentionny other objects. she
soon learnt thaty weredebted forir present good understanding
efforts hisunt, who did call on him her return through
london,ndre relate her journey longbourn,s motive,nd
substance her conversation elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression latter which, her ladyship'spprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perversenessndssurance; belief that
such relation mustssist her endeavours obtathat promise
from her nephew which she had refused give. but, unluckily fher
ladyship,s effect had been exactly contrariwise.

“taught me hope,” said he, “as i had scarcely everllowed myself
hope before. i knew enough your disposition be certathat,
had you beenbsolutely, irrevocably decidedgainst me, you would have
acknowledged lady catherine, franklynd openly.”

elizabeth colourednd laugheds she replied, “yes, you know enough
my frankness believe me capable _that_.fterbusing you so
abominably your face, i could have no scruplebusing youll
your relations.”

“what did you say me, that i did not deserve? for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour yout time had merited severest reproof. was
unpardonable. i cannot thinkoutbhorrence.”

“we will not quarrel fgreater share blamennexed that
evening,” said elizabeth. “conduct neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but sincen, we have both, i hope, improved
civility.”

“i cannot be so easily reconciled myself. recollection what i
then said, my conduct, my manners, my expressions during whole
it, is now,nd has been many months,expressibly painful me. your
reproof, so wellpplied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved
more gentlemanlike manner.' those were your words. you know not, you can
scarcely conceive, howy havertured me;--though was some time,
i confess, before i was reasonable enoughllowir justice.”

“i was certainly very far from expectingm make so strongn
impression. i had not smallest ideofir being ever felt such
way.”

“i can easily believe. you thought men devoid every proper
feeling, im sure you did. turn your countenance i shall never
forget,s you said that i could not haveddressed youny possible
way that wouldduce youccept me.”

“oh! do not repeat what said.se recollections will not dot
all. issure you that i have long been most heartilyshamed.”

darcy mentioned his letter. “did,” said he, “did soon make you
think better me? did you, on reading, giveny credtos
contents?”

she explained whats effect on her had been,nd how graduallyll her
former prejudices had been removed.

“i knew,” said he, “that what i wrote must give you pain, but was
necessary. i hope you have destroyed letter.re was one part
especially, opening, which i should dread your having
power readinggain. i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.”

“letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe essential
preservation my regard; but, though we have both reason think my
opinions not entirely unalterable,yre not, i hope, quite so easily
changeds that implies.”

“when i wrote that letter,” replied darcy, “i believed myself perfectly
calmnd cool, but im since convinced that was written
dreadful bitterness spirit.”

“letter, perhaps, began bitterness, but did not end so.
adieu is charityself. but think no more letter. feelings
person who wrote,nd person who received,re now
so widely different from whaty weren, that every unpleasant
circumstancettending ought be forgotten. you must learn some
my philosophy. think only pastss remembrance gives you
pleasure.”

“i cannot give you credforny philosophy kind. your
retrospections must be sotally void reproach, that contentment
arising fromm is not philosophy, but, what is much better,
innocence. but me, is not so. painful recollections willtrude
which cannot, which ought not, be repelled. i have been selfish
beingll my life, practice, though not principle.s child i
was taught what was right, but i was not taught correct my temper. i
was given good principles, but left followm pridend conceit.
unfortunatelyn only son (fmany yearsn only child), i was spoilt
by my parents, who, though goodmselves (my father, particularly,ll
that was benevolentndmiable),llowed, encouraged,lmost taught
me be selfishnd overbearing; care fnone beyond my own family
circle; think meanlyll rest world; wisht least
think meanlyir sensend worth compared my own. such i
was, from eight eightnd twenty;nd such i might still have been
but fyou, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you
taught me lesson, harddeedt first, but mostdvantageous. by you,
i was properly humbled. i came youout doubt my reception.
you showed me howsufficient werell my pretensions please woman
worthy being pleased.”

“had youn persuaded yourself that i should?”

“indeed i had. what will you think my vanity? i believed you be
wishing, expecting myddresses.”

“my manners must have been fault, but nottentionally, issure
you. i never meant deceive you, but my spirits mightten lead me
wrong. how you must have hated mefter _that_ evening?”

“hate you! i wasngry perhapst first, but mynger soon began take
proper direction.”

“imlmostfraidsking what you thought me, when we mett
pemberley. you blamed me fcoming?”

“nodeed; i felt nothing but surprise.”

“your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ being noticed by you.
my conscienceld me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness,nd i
confess that i did not expect receive _more_ than my due.”

“my objectn,” replied darcy, “was show you, by every civility
my power, that i was not so means resent past;nd i hoped
obtayour forgiveness, lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had beenttended. how soonny other wishes
introducedmselves i can hardly tell, but i believebout halfn
hourfter i had seen you.”

henld her georgiana's delight hercquaintance,nd her
disappointmentts suddenterruption; which naturally leading
cause thatterruption, she soon learnt that his resolution
following her from derbyshire quest her sister had been formed
before he quittedn,nd that his gravitynd thoughtfulness
there hadrisen from no other struggles than what such purpose must
comprehend.

she expressed her gratitudegain, but waso painful subject
each, be dwelt on farther.

after walking several miles leisurely manner,ndo busy know
anythingbout,y foundt last, on examiningir watches, that
was time bet home.

“what could become mr. bingleynd jane!” was wonder which
introduced discussionirffairs. darcy was delighted
their engagement; his friend had given him earliestformation
it.

“i mustsk whether you were surprised?” said elizabeth.

“nottll. when i wentway, i felt that would soon happen.”

“that is say, you had given your permission. i guesseds much.”nd
though he exclaimedt term, she found that had been pretty much
case.

“on evening before my going london,” said he, “i made
confession him, which i believe i ought have made longgo. i
told himll that had occurred make my formerterference his
affairsbsurdnd impertinent. his surprise was great. he had never had
slightest suspicion. ild him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken supposing,s i had done, that your sister wasdifferent
him;nds i could easily perceive that histtachment her was
unabated, i felt no doubtir happinessgether.”

elizabeth could not help smilingt his easy manner directing his
friend.

“did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when yould him
that my sister loved him, merely from myformation last spring?”

“from former. i had narrowly observed her during two visits
which i had lately made here;nd i was convinced herffection.”

“yourssurance, i suppose, carried immediate conviction
him.”

“did. bingley is most unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment sonxious case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. i was obliged confess
one thing, which ftime,nd not unjustly,fended him. i could not
allow myself conceal that your sister had beenwn three months
last winter, that i had known,nd purposely kept from him. he was
angry. but hisnger, im persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
inny doubt your sister's sentiments. he has heartily forgiven me
now.”

elizabeth longed observe that mr. bingley had been most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth wasvaluable; but she checked
herself. she remembered that he had yet learn be laughedt,

chapter 59


“my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking?” was question
which elizabeth received from janes soons she enteredir room,
fromll others wheny sat down table. she had only
say reply, thaty had wanderedbout, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. she coloureds she spoke; but neither that, nornything
else,wakened suspicion truth.

evening passed quietly, unmarked bynything extraordinary.
acknowledged lovers talkednd laughed, unacknowledged were silent.
darcy was not disposition which happiness overflows mirth;
elizabeth,gitatednd confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself be so; for, besides immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. shenticipated what would be felt
family when her situation became known; she wasware that no
one liked him but jane;nd even feared that others was
dislike which notll his fortunend consequence might doway.

at night she opened her heart jane. though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits, she wasbsolutelycredulous here.

“youre joking, lizzy. cannot be!--engaged mr. darcy! no, no,
you shall not deceive me. i know be impossible.”

“is wretched beginningdeed! my sole dependence was on you;nd
im sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. yet,deed, im
earnest. i speak nothing but truth. he still loves me,nd were
engaged.”

jane lookedt her doubtingly. “oh, lizzy! cannot be. i know how much
you dislike him.”

“you know nothing matter. _that_ isll be forgot. perhaps i
did notlways love him so wells i do now. but such casess
these, good memory is unpardonable. is last time i shall ever
remember myself.”

miss bennet still lookedllmazement. elizabethgain,nd more
seriouslyssured hers truth.

“good heaven! can be really so! yet now i must believe you,” cried
jane. “my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--butre you
certain? forgive question--are you quite certathat you can be
happy him?”

“there can be no doubt that. is settled between uslready, that
were be happiest couple world. butre you pleased,
jane? shall you like have such brother?”

“very, very much. nothing could give either bingley myself more
delight. but we considered, we talkeds impossible.nd do you
really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! donything rather than
marryoutffection.re you quite sure that you feel what you ought
do?”

“oh, yes! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought do, when i
tell youll.”

“what do you mean?”

“why, i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley. im
afraid you will bengry.”

“my dearest sister, now _be_ serious. i want talk very seriously. let
me know every thing that im know,out delay. will you tell me
how long you have loved him?”

“has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when began.
but i believe i must date from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley.”

another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced
desired effect;nd she soon satisfied jane by her solemnssurances
ofttachment. when convinced on thatrticle, miss bennet had nothing
further wish.

“now im quite happy,” said she, “fyou will bes happys myself.
ilways had value fhim. were fnothing but his love you,
i mustlways have esteemed him; but now,s bingley's friendnd your
husband,re can be only bingleynd yourself more dear me. but
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved me. how little did you
tell me what passedt pemberleynd lambton! i owell that i know
ofnother, not you.”

elizabethld her motives her secrecy. she had been unwilling
mention bingley;nd unsettled state her own feelings had made
her equallyvoid name his friend. but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share lydia's marriage.ll wascknowledged,
half night spent conversation.

                          * * * * *

“good gracious!” cried mrs. bennet,s she stoodt window next
morning, “if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming heregain
our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresomes belways
coming here? i had no notion but he would go-shooting, something
other,nd not disturb us his company. what shall we do him?
lizzy, you must walk out himgain, that he may not be bingley's
way.”

elizabeth could hardly help laughingt so convenient proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should belways giving him suchn
epithet.

as soonsy entered, bingley lookedt her so expressively,nd
shook hands such warmth,s left no doubt his goodformation;
he soonfterwards saidloud, “mrs. bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts which lizzy may lose her waygain-day?”

“idvise mr. darcy,nd lizzy,nd kitty,” said mrs. bennet, “walk
oakham mount morning. is nice long walk,nd mr. darcy has
never seen view.”

“may do very well fothers,” replied mr. bingley; “but im
sure will beo much fkitty. won't, kitty?” kitty owned that
she had rather stayt home. darcy professed great curiosity see
view from mount,nd elizabeth silently consented.s she went
up stairs get ready, mrs. bennet followed her, saying:

“im quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced have that
disagreeable manll yourself. but i hope you will not mind: is
all fjane's sake, you know;ndre is no occasion ftalking
him, except just nowndn. so, do not put yourself
inconvenience.”

duringir walk, was resolved that mr. bennet's consent should be
asked course evening. elizabeth reserved herself
application fher mother's. she could not determine how her mother
would take; sometimes doubting whetherll his wealthnd grandeur
would be enough overcome herbhorrence man. but whether she
were violently setgainst match, violently delighted,
was certathat her manner would be equally illdapted do credit
her sense;nd she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear
first raptures her joy, than first vehemence her
disapprobation.

                          * * * * *

evening, soonfter mr. bennetdrew library, she saw
mr. darcy riselsond follow him,nd hergitation on seeing was
extreme. she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going
be made unhappy;nd that should be through her means--that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him fearsnd regrets disposing her--was wretched
reflection,nd she sat misery till mr. darcyppearedgain, when,
lookingt him, she was little relieved by his smile. few minutes
hepproached table where she was sitting kitty;nd, while
pretendingdmire her work said whisper, “go your father, he
wants you library.” she was gone directly.

her father was walkingbout room, looking gravendnxious.
“lizzy,” said he, “whatre you doing?re you out your senses, be
accepting man? have not youlways hated him?”

how earnestly did shen wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! would have spared her from
explanationsnd professions which was exceedinglywkward give;
buty were now necessary,nd shessured him, some confusion,
herttachment mr. darcy.

“or, other words, youre determined have him. he is rich, be
sure,nd you may have more fine clothesnd fine carriages than jane.
but willy make you happy?”

“have youny other objection,” said elizabeth, “than your belief my
indifference?”

“nonetll. well know him be proud, unpleasant sort man; but
would be nothing if you really liked him.”

“i do, i do like him,” she replied, tears her eyes, “i love him.
indeed he has no improper pride. he is perfectlymiable. you do not
know what he really is;n pray do not pame by speaking him
such terms.”

“lizzy,” said her father, “i have given him my consent. he is kind
man,deed, whom i should never dare refusenything, which he
condescendedsk. i now give _you_, if youre resolved on
having him. but let medvise you think better. i know
your disposition, lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up hims superior. your lively talents would place you
greatest dangern unequal marriage. you could scarcely escape
discreditnd misery. my child, let me not have grief seeing
_you_ unable respect your partner life. you know not what youre
about.”

elizabeth, still moreffected, was earnestnd solemn her reply;nd
at length, by repeatedssurances that mr. darcy was really object
her choice, by explaining gradual change which her estimation
him had undergone, relating herbsolute certainty that hisffection
was not work day, but had stood test many months'
suspense,nd enumerating energyll his good qualities, she did
conquer her father'scredulity,nd reconcile him match.

“well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “i have no more
say. if be case, he deserves you. i could not have parted
you, my lizzy,nyone less worthy.”

complete favourable impression, shenld him what mr. darcy
had voluntarily done flydia. he heard herstonishment.

“isn evening wonders,deed!nd so, darcy did every thing;
made up match, gave money, paid fellow's debts,nd got him
his commission! so much better. will save me world trouble
economy. had been your uncle's doing, i mustnd _would_ have
paid him; butse violent young lovers carry every thingir own
way. i shallfer pay him-morrow; he will rantnd stormbout
his love fyou,ndre will ben end matter.”

hen recollected her embarrassment few days before, on his reading
mr. collins's letter;ndfter laughingt her some time,llowed her
at last go--saying,s she quitted room, “ifny young men come
fmary kitty, sendm, fim quitet leisure.”

elizabeth's mind was now relieved from very heavy weight;nd,fter
halfn hour's quiet reflection her own room, she wasble join
otherslerable composure. every thing waso recent for
gaiety, but evening passed tranquillyway;re was no longer
anything material be dreaded,nd comfort easend familiarity
would come time.

when her mother went up her dressing-roomt night, she followed her,
made important communication.s effect was most extraordinary;
fon first hearing, mrs. bennet sat quite still,nd unable
utter syllable. nwas under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard; though not general backward credit
what was fordvantage her family, that came shape
lovernym. she begant length recover, fidgetbout
her chair, get up, sdowngain, wonder,nd bless herself.

“good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr. darcy! who would
have thought!nd is really true? oh! my sweetest lizzy! how rich
how great you will be! what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! jane's is nothing--nothingtll. im so
pleased--so happy. such charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--oh, my
dear lizzy! praypologise fmy having disliked him so much before. i
hope he will overlook. dear, dear lizzy. housewn! every thing
that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousyear! oh,
lord! what will become me. i shall go distracted.”

was enough prove that herpprobation need not be doubted:nd
elizabeth, rejoicing that suchn effusion was heard only by herself,
soon wentway. but before she had been three minutes her own room,
her mother followed her.

“my dearest child,” she cried, “i can think nothing else! ten
thousyear,nd very likely more! 'tiss goods lord!nd
special licence. you mustnd shall be married by special licence. but
my dearest love, tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond,
that i may have-morrow.”

was sad omen what her mother's behaviour gentleman
himself might be;nd elizabeth found that, though certain
possession his warmestffection,nd secure her relations'
consent,re was still something be wished for. but morrow
passedf much better than she expected; fmrs. bennet luckily stood
suchwe hertended son-in-law that she ventured not speak
him, unless was her powerfer himnyttention, mark her
deference fhis opinion.

elizabeth had satisfaction seeing her father taking pains get
acquainted him;nd mr. bennet soonssured her that he was rising
every hour his esteem.

“idmirell my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husbquites well
as jane's.”



chapter 60


elizabeth's spirits soon rising playfulnessgain, she wanted mr.
darcyccount fhis having ever fallen love her. “how could
you begin?” said she. “i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made beginning; but what could set youf first
place?”

“i cannot fix on hour, spot, look, words, which
laid foundation. iso longgo. i was middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun.”

“my beauty you had earlystood,nds fmy manners--my behaviour
_you_ wast leastlways bordering on uncivil,nd i never spoke
youout rather wishing give you pathan not. now be sincere;
did youdmire me fmy impertinence?”

“fliveliness your mind, i did.”

“you mays well call impertinencet once. was very little less.
fact is, that you were sick civility, deference,ficious
attention. you were disgusted women who werelways speaking,
looking,nd thinking f_your_pprobationlone. i roused,nd
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_. had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for; but spite pains you
took disguise yourself, your feelings werelways noblend just;nd
your heart, you thoroughly despised persons who sossiduously
courted you.re--i have saved you troubleccounting for
it;nd really,ll things considered, i begthink perfectly
reasonable. be sure, you knew noctual good me--but nobody thinks
_that_ wheny fall love.”

“wasre no good yourffectionate behaviour jane while she was
illt netherfield?”

“dearest jane! who could have done less fher? but make virtue
byll means. my good qualitiesre under your protection,nd youre
exaggeratems muchs possible;nd, return, belongs me
find occasions fteasingnd quarrelling youstens may
be;nd i shall begdirectly bysking you what made you so unwilling
come pointt last. what made you so shy me, when you first
called,ndfterwards dined here? why, especially, when you called, did
you looks if you did not carebout me?”

“because you were gravend silent,nd gave me no encouragement.”

“but i was embarrassed.”

“so was i.”

“you might have talked me more when you came dinner.”

“man who had felt less, might.”

“how unlucky that you should have reasonablenswer give,nd that
i should be so reasonablesdmit! but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left yourself. i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if i had notsked you! my resolution
thanking you fyour kindness lydihad certainly great effect.
_too much_, imfraid; fwhat becomes moral, if our comfort
springs from breach promise? fi ought not have mentioned
subject. will never do.”

“you need not distress yourself. moral will be perfectly fair. lady
catherine's unjustifiable endeavours separate us were means
removingll my doubts. im notdebted fmy present happiness
your eager desire expressing your gratitude. i was not humour
waforny opening yours. myunt'stelligence had given me
hope,nd i was determinedt once know every thing.”

“lady catherine has beenfinite use, which ought make her happy,
fshe loves be use. but tell me, what did you come down
netherfield for? was merely ride longbournnd be embarrassed?
had youtendedny more serious consequence?”

“my real purpose was see _you_,nd judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope make you love me. myvowed one, what ivowed
myself, was see whether your sister were still partial bingley,
if she were, make confession him which i have since made.”

“shall you ever have couragennounce lady catherine what is
befall her?”

“im more likely want more time than courage, elizabeth. but
ought be done,nd if you will give me sheet paper, shall be
done directly.”

“if i had not letter write myself, i might sby yound
admire evenness your writing,snother young lady once did. but
i havenunt,o, who must not be longer neglected.”

fromn unwillingness confess how much hertimacy mr. darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yetnswered mrs. gardiner's
long letter; but now, having _that_ communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she waslmostshamed find that her unclend
aunt hadlready lost three days happiness,nd immediately wrotes
follows:

“i would have thanked you before, my dearunt,s i ought have done,
fyour long, kind, satisfactory, detail particulars; but say
truth, i waso cross write. you supposed more than really existed.
but _now_ supposes muchs you choose; give loose reyour
fancy,dulge your imagination every possible flight which
subject willfford,nd unless you believe mectually married, you
cannot greatly err. you must writegavery soon,nd praise him
great deal more than you did your last. i thank you,gainndgain,
fnot going lakes. how could i be so sillys wish! your
ideponies is delightful. we will go round park every day. i
am happiest creature world. perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one such justice. im happier even than jane; she
only smiles, i laugh. mr. darcy sends youll love world that
he can spare from me. yourell come pemberleyt christmas.
yours, etc.”

mr. darcy's letter lady catherine was different style;nd still
different from either was what mr. bennet sent mr. collins, reply
his last.

“dear sir,

“i must trouble you once more fcongratulations. elizabeth will soon
be wife mr. darcy. console lady catherines wells you can.
but, if i were you, i would stby nephew. he has more give.

“yours sincerely, etc.”

miss bingley's congratulations her brother, on hispproaching
marriage, werell that wasffectionatendsincere. she wrote even
jane on occasion, express her delight,nd repeatll her
former professions regard. jane was not deceived, but she was
affected;nd though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her much kindernswer than she knew was deserved.

joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similarformation,
wass sinceres her brother's sending. four sides paper were
insufficient containll her delight,ndll her earnest desire
being loved by her sister.

beforenynswer couldrrive from mr. collins,ny congratulations
elizabeth from his wife, longbourn family heard that
collinses were comemselves lucas lodge. reason
sudden removal was soon evident. lady catherine had been rendered
so exceedinglyngry by contents her nephew's letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing match, wasnxious getway till
storm was blown over.t such moment,rrival her friend
was sincere pleasure elizabeth, though courseir
meetings she must sometimes think pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr. darcy exposedll paradingnd obsequious civility
her husband. he bore, however,dmirable calmness. he could even
listen sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carryingway
brightest jewel country,nd expressed his hopesirll
meeting frequentlyt st. james's, very decent composure. if he did
shrug his shoulders, was not till sir william was out sight.

mrs. phillips's vulgarity wasnother,nd perhaps greater, tax on his
forbearance;nd though mrs. phillips,s wells her sister, stood
too muchwe him speak familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
nwas her respect fhim, though made her more quiet,tll
likely make her more elegant. elizabeth didll she could shield
him from frequent notice either,nd was evernxious keep
him herself,nd those her family whom he might converse
without mortification;nd though uncomfortable feelingsrising
fromllok from season courtship muchs pleasure,
added hope future;nd she looked forward delight
time wheny should be removed from society so little pleasing
either,ll comfortnd eleganceir family partyt
pemberley.



chapter 61


happy forll her maternal feelings was day on which mrs. bennet got
rid her two most deserving daughters. what delighted pride
shefterwards visited mrs. bingley,nd talked mrs. darcy, may
be guessed. i wish i could say, fsake her family, that
accomplishment her earnest desire establishment so many
her children produced so happyn effects make her sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman frest her life; though perhaps
was lucky fher husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
so unusual form, that she still was occasionally nervousnd
invariably silly.

mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; hisffection fher
drew himtener from home thannything else could do. he delighted
going pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

mr. bingleynd jane remainedt netherfield only twelvemonth. so near
vicinity her mothernd meryton relations was not desirable even
_his_ easy temper, _her_ffectionate heart. darling wish his
sisters wasn gratified; he boughtn estate neighbouring county
derbyshire,nd janend elizabeth,ddition every other source
happiness, werethirty miles each other.

kitty, her very materialdvantage, spent chief her time
her two elder sisters. society so superiwhat she had generally
known, her improvement was great. she was not so ungovernable
tempers lydia;nd, removed fromfluence lydia's example,
she became, by properttentionnd management, less irritable, less
ignorant,nd lesssipid. from further disadvantage lydia's
society she was course carefully kept,nd though mrs. wickham
frequentlyvited her comend stay her, promise
ballsnd young men, her father would never consent her going.

mary was only daughter who remainedt home;nd she was necessarily
drawn from pursuofccomplishments by mrs. bennet's being quite
unable sitlone. mary was obliged mix more world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit;nds she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beautynd her own,
was suspected by her father that she submitted changeout
much reluctance.

as fwickhamnd lydia,ir characters suffered no revolution from
marriage her sisters. he bore philosophy conviction that
elizabeth must now becomecquainted whatever hisgratitude
falsehood had before been unknown her;nd spite every
thing, was not whollyout hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
make his fortune. congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydion her marriage, explained her that, by his wifet least,
if not by himself, such hope was cherished. letter was
effect:

“my dear lizzy,

“i wish you joy. if you love mr. darcy halfs wells i do my dear
wickham, you must be very happy. is great comfort have you so
rich,nd when you have nothing else do, i hope you will think us.
im sure wickham would like placet court very much,nd i do not
think we shall have quite money enough live uponout some help.
any place would do,bout three four hundred year; but however,
do not speak mr. darcybout, if you had rather not.

“yours, etc.”

as happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured
hernswer putn end every entreatynd expectation kind.
such relief, however,s was her powerfford, by practice
what might be called economy her own private expences, she
frequently sentm. hadlways been evident her that suchn
incomesirs, under direction two persons so extravagant
their wants,nd heedless future, must be verysufficient
their support;nd whenevery changedir quarters, either jane
herself were sure beingpplied fsome littlessistance
towards dischargingir bills.ir manner living, even when
restoration peace dismissedm home, was unsettled
extreme.y werelways moving from place place quest cheap
situation,ndlways spending more thany ought. hisffection for
her soon sunkindifference; hers lasted little longer;nd
spite her youthnd her manners, she retainedll claims
reputation which her marriage had given her.

though darcy could never receive _him_t pemberley, yet, for
elizabeth's sake, hessisted him further his profession. lydiwas
occasionally visitorre, when her husbwas gone enjoy himself
london bath;nd bingleysy bothm frequently
staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome,nd he
proceeded so fars talk givingm hint be gone.

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; buts she
thoughtdvisable retaright visitingt pemberley, she
droptll her resentment; was fonder than ever georgiana,lmosts
attentive darcys heretofore,nd paidf everyrrear civility
elizabeth.

pemberley was now georgiana's home;ndttachment sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped see.y wereble love each
other evens wellsytended. georgianhad highest opinion
world elizabeth; thought first sheten listened
anstonishment bordering onlarmt her lively, sportive, manner
talking her brother. he, who hadlwaysspired herself respect
whichlmost overcame herffection, she now saw object open
pleasantry. her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
her way. by elizabeth'sstructions, she began comprehend that
woman may take liberties her husbwhich brother will not
alwaysllow sister more than ten years younger than himself.

lady catherine was extremelydignant on marriage her nephew;
ands she gave wayll genuine frankness her character
her reply letter whichnnouncedsrrangement, she sent him
language so verybusive, especially elizabeth, that fsome time
alltercourse wastn end. butt length, by elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on overlookfence,nd seek reconciliation;
and,fter little further resistance on part hisunt, her
resentment gave way, either herffection fhim, her curiosity
see how his wife conducted herself;nd she condescended wait
onmt pemberley, spite that pollution whichs woods had
received, not merely from presence such mistress, but
visits her unclendunt from city.

gardiners,y werelways on mosttimate terms.
darcy,s wells elizabeth, really lovedm;ndy were both ever
sensible warmest gratitudewards persons who, by bringing
